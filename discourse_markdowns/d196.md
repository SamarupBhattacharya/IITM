reconstructed1_vicky 1024×1024 231 KB this is my image i coded corrrect mapped to correct pixel but it was saying pixel do not match what is meaning of it
The image is a collage of sepia-toned illustrations, combining portraits of men in suits and various hats with diagrams, gears, charts, and mechanical elements. The illustrations have a vintage technical drawing style, with text fragments accompanying the images, creating a complex and interconnected composition.
sorry i found correct answer i was thinking differently
can someone share the answer for the 9th question as i am facing some errors
Create your gemini api, convert the video into MP4 and then write the Collab code for the question or ask gpt to write it for you…finally run it on google collab
Hi @Algsoch @24f2003130 While saving image you might need to pass lossless = True as argument. img.save("filename", lossless=True) kind regards
u can use openai whisper free and use yt-dlp package to extract the video and using whisper convert it
For Q8, I wrote the following query, SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id; What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order. But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.
yeah i did the same but the transcript was not the same. it had many differences
Sir @s.anand @carlton the answer is correct but still getting as incorrect sir image 1920×1080 247 KB after trying python codes chatgpt i tried using linux commands bash-5.2$ zgrep ‘GET /malayalammp3/’ s-anand.net-May-2024.gz | grep -E ‘[(04|11|18|25)/May/2024:(10|11|12|13|14|15|16):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]’ | grep -E ’ “(GET|POST) .* HTTP/1.[01]” (2[0-9][0-9]) ’ | wc -l 2316 i’m getting 2316 but when i enter in the answer box it says incorrect
The image shows a graded assignment related to web server logs. The task is to determine the number of successful GET requests for pages under `/malayalammp3/` on Saturdays between 10:00 and 17:00. The user's answer "2316" was marked incorrect. Information about request structure and fields in the log file is also given.

Q9 , extracted text from yt and processed the srt file,  getting 77 differences  adding any word the diff count is increasing . Please tell what i am missing here.
downloading and using this image will given an error,  better generate it yourself.
AE means UAE and so on…
Hi @23f3004114 Question 9 might not be solved 100% automatically, Manually listen to audio once or twice and correct few things. Kind regards
Q9 Note : I found that punctuations are also checked. So make sure you include punctuations inside the paragraph wherever it is effective according to the voice in the paragraph
@21f3001379 @Jivraj , thank you for the replies . i stopped after 8/10. need to prepare for Quiz 1.
The image shows a simple, cartoon-style red heart with shading that gives it a slight 3D appearance. It's a classic representation of love, affection, or general positive emotions. The background is black, making the heart stand out.

This case is the same with me
Yeah I did…I am done with that
it is asking successful GET requests, you can know if a request is successful or not by checking the status data given in the file
Sir, Q8 is giving errors everytime.
It’s mentioned that 200-299 is successful requests
