hello please say on ngrok i want to share ngrok method ‘’ but i have to open all days right on
Hi. I got a new laptop and was wondering how to recover my AIPROXY token. How do I get it? If I remember correctly it has something to do with my iiim email
@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription. For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer. So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation. Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question? Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster. Regards, Shivaditya
For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like http://ip :port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint? @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj
Yes we’ll take that into consideration.
For GA 5 - Q10 - do we have to return base64 encoded image or the url of the image?
Base64 encoded string
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini q-vercel-python.json will be same or different? image 1548×391 39.2 KB Will the llamafile be same? image 780×221 21.5 KB
This image describes a task: download a JSON file containing student marks, deploy a Python app on Vercel to expose an API, and return a JSON response containing the marks for names X and Y upon request. It also shows an example JSON response and emphasizes enabling CORS for GET requests. The task requires defining the Vercel URL.

The image shows instructions to download a Llamafile model and create a tunnel to the server using ngrok. It then asks for the ngrok URL and provides an example of what the URL might look like. The actual ngrok URL is displayed as: https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app.
hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website image 788×325 9.21 KB
The image presents a challenge: find the hidden value in a webpage input. Text prompts indicate a hidden input field located above the visible input box, and asks the user to enter the correct value. A "Check" button implies a way to verify the answer.

hello for this question i am using approach like initially i login and saved seession now it is giving output like it login internally to website of college ga1 and then find image 974×281 14.5 KB
The image prompts a CSS selection question. It asks to find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden element, and then calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes. An input field is provided to enter the sum, followed by a "Check" button.
I asked this question in the gmeet. They said html will be provided in the question and u have to find the hidden input from there. Same for css selectors
image 859×556 23 KB do you know answer of this that time i got answer
The image shows a SQLite table named "tickets" with columns "type", "units", and "price", representing customer bids for concert tickets. Ticket types include bronze and silver. The prompt asks to calculate the total sales for "Gold" ticket types using SQL.
but i got wrong answer
@carlton Could you please consider the above request for an extension? There are still many updates needed, and the project is close to completion. I am confident you will be pleased with the final results.
image 439×459 28.4 KB Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use  the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isn’t it , Sir? @carlton @Karthik_POD
The image depicts a form for an "AI Assignment Solver." It allows users to upload a file or ask a question directly. A "Choose File" button indicates file upload capability, while an input field is available for entering questions. The form includes upload and submit buttons and a designated area for the answer.
image 643×576 36.1 KB This is the output Sir @carlton @Karthik_POD . Also my project-1 has not been scored .. till now .. Please review that also. Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread - #240
The image displays a list of numerical values, initially with negative signs. It then sums a subset of these values: 1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 + 20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00, and declares that the total value of complaints is **2,073,684.00**.
Hi @22f3000370 We appreciate the efforts you have put in. But, for the project we aren’t expecting a full-stack app with an integrated frontend. We just need an API endpoint on which we would be able to send requests in the given format. For more info check the TDS course page. Tools in Data Science
@Saransh_Saini Is answer in this form acceptable.. image 2726×1489 463 KB
The image shows a server response to a POST request sent using `curl`. The request, made to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`, contained a question related to "ShopSmart". The server responded with a 200 OK status and a JSON body containing a Python function for calculating cosine similarity between embeddings, finding the most similar phrases and an example use with cosine similarity data.

image 1454×433 30.4 KB I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay
The image shows the Render.com dashboard for a web service named "TDS-Project-2," which uses Python 3 and operates on a free instance. A warning indicates that the instance will spin down with inactivity, causing potential request delays. A deployment on March 31, 2025, is in progress, with "Final Commit." Users can connect, manually deploy, or upgrade the instance.
