As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using json.load() , it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using json.loads( ) . For clarity I add image below. This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big. I guess @Jivraj is right. image 562×700 23.4 KB
The code initially attempts to load a Python dictionary directly into `json.loads`, which expects a string, byte, or bytearray, resulting in a `TypeError`.  The correction converts the dictionary to a JSON string using `json.dumps` before loading it with `json.loads`, resolving the error and successfully printing "26272".
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hi, while trying to creating podman image of my application, it is being created as 7.2GB file. Any idea what should i do? Also, I can sign up for azure student pack, are there any way to deploy my application? Thanks
Subject: Request for Uniform Evaluation Process in Project 2 - TDS Solver. Hello @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir. We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach. However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding. Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama.
image 698×405 17.4 KB For this question, The answer which we get is not same as the expected answer which the portal fetch through proxy fetch image 733×201 38.2 KB let h = await fetch('/proxy/…) ------------> here @Jivraj @carlton sir because of this mismatch we have to edit manually after clicking check button again and again please guide me how to solve this
The task involves using IMDb's advanced search to find movies with ratings between 2 and 8. Extract the ID, title, year, and rating for the first 25 titles.  Format this data into a JSON structure, extracting the movie ID from the URL.  Submit the resulting JSON data.
The code snippet is fetching and parsing data from IMDb to extract movie information. It fetches HTML content from a proxy IMDb URL based on user ratings. If successful, it parses the HTML, extracts the ID, title, year, and rating, and returns them as an object. Error handling is implemented if the data retrieval fails.
@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong. No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.
Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do Remove unused libraries from your requirements.txt . Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like SentenceTransformers can install large sub-dependency packages. Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation Create a .containerignore file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip. Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.
Hi @21f2000588 , Your concerns sound genuine and we will put this point up during our discussion sessions. Whatever would be the decision we will inform you guys. Regards, Saransh Saini
In the previous replies, you’ve mentioned that for Github questions → actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same. For GA2 Q9 → I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question. image 1932×1748 225 KB @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
This image shows an API endpoint for uploading a CSV file to retrieve student data, with the option to filter by class. The request uses a POST method with a 'multipart/form-data' content type, requiring a file named 'testapi.csv'. A successful response returns a JSON array of student objects, each with a 'studentId' and 'class'.
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right? image 1602×275 34.1 KB So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?
The image describes a system for talent acquisition leveraging data-driven decisions. It highlights competitive intelligence, efficiency through automation, and the importance of reliable data.  The system searches for GitHub users based on location and follower count, sorting by join date. Users are prompted to enter a date in ISO 8601 format to filter based on join date.

Hi @22f3000819 Thanks for bringing this into light, we’ll keep this in mind while creating the evaluation script.
This will be sent as a parameter in along with the API request.
Okay sure, thank you so much. I hope you take this into consideration. Thanks and Regards Digvijaysinh Chudasama
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton For GA4, Q9 on Tabula - Tabula requires Java Runtime to install. How to deploy it on Vercel?
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Please give us some clarification on this query
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton please give us some clarification on this query.
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini please clarify
please provide clarification on this as deadline is close. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj
@jivraj @Saransh_Saini same issue… What are your final thoughts?
sir GA10 i have designed it as this output of that quesiton is Successfully reconstructed the image. Saved to: E:\data science tool\GA5\output\reconstructed_jigsaw.png is this correct or we have to show image directory or folder or image
You have to return the image output as base64 encoded data
