The image displays a white, lowercase letter "s" against a solid, muted blue-gray background. The "s" is centered in the frame and appears to be a common sans-serif font. The image is simple and focuses solely on the letterform.

thanks for the help…
@23f3002537 , @21f3000745 , @Jeleshiya Anyone who received the Nur-Sultan parameter for this question and at least attempted it will get a mark. Kind regards
sir what about bonus marks cuz my score was 9/10 due to q4(Nur-sultan).
The bonus mark will be processed afterwards. That is checked before the scores are pushed to portal.
Nominatim API gives me the bounding box of the location. How exactly the bounding box helps me to find the details of the location?
I am facing issues in Q9 , can you help me out?
const movies = ; document.querySelectorAll(‘.sc-d5ea4b9d-0.ejavrk’).forEach((item, index) => { if (index >= 25) return; // Stop after collecting 25 movies const titleElement = item.querySelector('.ipc-title__text');
const yearElement = item.querySelector('.sc-d5ea4b9d-7.URyjV.dli-title-metadata-item');
const ratingElement = item.querySelector('.ipc-rating-star--rating');

if (titleElement && yearElement) {
    const idMatch = item.querySelector('a[href*="/title/tt"]')?.href.match(/tt(\d+)/);
    const id = idMatch ? `tt${idMatch[1]}` : null;
    const title = titleElement.innerText.trim();
    //const yearText = yearElement.innerText.replace(/\D/g, "").trim(); // Remove non-numeric characters
    const yearText = yearElement.innerText.trim();
    const year = yearText ? yearText : null; // Keep year as a string
    const rating = ratingElement ? ratingElement.innerText.trim() : null; // Keep rating as a string

    if (id && title && year && rating && parseFloat(rating) >= 3 && parseFloat(rating) <= 5) {
        movies.push({ id, title, year, rating });
    }
} }); // Output JSON data with no spaces after colon console.log(JSON.stringify(movies, (key, value) => typeof value === ‘string’ ? value.trim() : value, 0));
image 1903×808 62.7 KB sir i have completed and saved the test but it shows score 0. and also image 1735×772 124 KB the graded assignment is showing like i didn’t submit it. please check on this.
The image shows a learning platform interface, possibly an assignment. It indicates that the deadline was February 9, 2025. IITM BS students can earn bonus marks by posting on the GA4 Data Sourcing discussion thread.  The user, logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, has recent saved scores of 8, 8, and 4.
The screenshot shows the "Graded Assignment 3" page within a course module. The due date for submission has passed. It provides troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment, including disabling ad blockers, allowing cookies, enabling JavaScript, using Chrome, and disabling potentially interfering extensions. It emphasizes the use of a valid student ID for grading and provides a link for accessing Graded Assignment 3.

Your most recent score will be considered, as long as you saved it before the deadline
Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. @carlton could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)? Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously. If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10. If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10. 21F1005510
