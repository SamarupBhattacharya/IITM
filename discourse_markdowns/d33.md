Mail I received Yesterday: Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-07 1174×451 54.2 KB Previous Correct Evaluation Mail: Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-35 1687×650 144 KB Good Morning Sir, This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.) I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter. @carlton
Project 1 requires passing prerequisite checks, including having a public and accessible GitHub repository with a MIT license file, a valid Dockerfile, and a public Docker image. The current evaluations show the Docker image passes, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license all fail. If all requirements are not met, the submission will not be evaluated.
This message provides feedback on a Docker image submission, including links to evaluation and Docker logs. It highlights potential issues such as responsiveness within 5 minutes and missing files that result in a zero score. The message shares evaluation parameters, invites bug reports until Tuesday, and notes that final scores will be normalized based on highest scores.
@Jivraj Sir, Please look into in this matter, no reply from your side till now and 2 days have been passed.
Apologies for that, The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation. Kind regards
Hi @carlton , I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails: The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.) The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy: First Evaluation Email 1511×724 76.2 KB Second Evaluation Email 1247×681 37.5 KB My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components: GitHub repo Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and assistance!
An email informs the recipient of the evaluated Project 1 Docker image submission, detailing the performance requirements and hardware setup used for evaluation. It provides links to evaluation and Docker logs and attaches server start, evaluation script, data generation, Docker orchestration, and solution script files. The email alerts to possible zero scores if files are missing, encourages reporting any discrepancies or bugs, and provides a deadline for appeals.
The email indicates a student's Project 1 score in TDS Jan 25 is 0 because prerequisites were not met.  Specifically, the GitHub repository is not public, and a Dockerfile and MIT license are missing from the repository's root. While the Docker image is publicly accessible, these failing checks prevent the submission from being evaluated.
Hi, Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.
You talking about me or @23f2000345 ?
Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir? My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds Thanking You Just attaching the mail I recieved. Screenshot 2025-04-12 104211 1429×750 71 KB
This email, titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores," provides feedback on a Docker image submission. It highlights potential issues like missing files, which result in a zero score. The email includes links to evaluation and Docker logs, alongside attached files like server start logs and a solution script, indicating the criteria and standards used for assessment.
Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error: tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ()) You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

Here's a 50-word summary of the image:

The image depicts a man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a purple collared shirt. He is facing the viewer with a slight smile. The background is a plain, light yellow or cream color. The image is a close-up, focusing primarily on the man's face and upper body.

Oh OK Sir. I will try it out. Thank You so much sir
Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below Screenshot 2025-04-12 115342 1466×702 50.4 KB Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave, uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 As I dont have evaluate.py But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir. Please guide me after this sir Thank You So much sir
The image shows a Docker build process, extracting layers, copying files, and installing dependencies via pip. The build exports the image, manifest, and config.  Finally, it runs the Docker image, starting a Uvicorn server on port 8000 and displays the message "Application startup complete." and the details of the Docker Desktop build.

The image shows a Docker build process. It includes extracting layers, copying files, installing dependencies with pip, and exporting the image with layers and manifests. After building, a Docker container is run, initiating a Uvicorn server on http://0.0.0.0:8000, indicating a successful startup.
URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile ) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
