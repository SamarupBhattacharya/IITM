The image shows a glossy, light blue square button. On the surface of this button is a large, white numeral "2." The button has a three-dimensional appearance, with lighter highlights suggesting a reflective surface.
The image displays a red pushpin against a black background. The pin has a rounded, red head and a short, silver-colored point extending from it. The style of the image is simple and slightly pixelated.

The image features a gray, rounded square. Centered within the square is the number "3" in white. The background is a gradient of gray, with the edges appearing darker than the center. The design is simple and easily readable.

Hi @carlton , Will this session be recorded and shared later? It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.
@carlton sir, I too prefer a recording. I did not even attend the session due to personal work which I couldn"t avoid. Pls support
@kushabarodekar @Muthupalaniappan As usual recording will be uploaded to youtube.
This is the recording of the session. Kind regards
The image captures a screen view of Anand S. on Google Meet. He is wearing a headset microphone and appears to be in a room with a plain white wall. An electrical outlet is visible on the wall. The background is somewhat blurry, with indistinct shapes present.
