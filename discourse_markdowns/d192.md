This image is a screenshot of the "TDS 2025 Jan ROE" exam page. It includes instructions emphasizing the freedom to use resources, check answers, save regularly, and acknowledges the quiz is hackable. A bonus mark is offered for filling a form before 5 PM IST for IITM students. It shows a logged-in IITM user and recent save history.
Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken. If not then, you will be marked absent.
