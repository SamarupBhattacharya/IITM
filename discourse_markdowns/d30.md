The image displays instructions to download a zip file, extract it using specific tools like unzip or 7-Zip to preserve timestamps, and then use "ls" command to list files with details. It poses a challenge: to calculate the total size of files larger than 2404 bytes and modified after March 18, 2002, 1:02 AM IST. A previous attempt, "485969", was incorrect.
Q18 GA1 I don’t get what’s wrong with this: image 1269×561 42 KB Can anyone help me understand? Thanks
The image describes a SQLite database table named "tickets" with columns "type", "units", and "price", representing customer bids for concert tickets.  The task is to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets using SQL, summing the product of "units" and "price" for rows where "type" is "gold", ignoring case. The provided query returns an incorrect value.

The image shows instructions for using `npx` and `prettier`. It directs the user to download `README.md`, ensure it's named correctly, and run a specified `npx` command with `prettier`. Finally, it asks for the expected output of the command, providing the SHA256 checksum as `AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C`.

The image shows a task involving converting a text file using multi-cursors into a JSON object. The key-value pairs need to be formatted correctly. The task requires pasting the resulting JSON into a specified website and clicking a 'Hash' button. An attempt has been made, resulting in an incorrect hash value and the message "Incorrect. Try again."
Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.
i am doing so only … i can send u the example - {   “0”: “wEfsmtde”, “83”: “NghqzO3DL”, “NqN7EcM”: “I”, “vFD2C”: “KAB”} i am not able to find what’s the mistake
Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.
Okay, i will go through my json object once. And for hash code i am using chrome only
It worked. Thank you
After passing the deadline , my scores aren’t there …Is it same for all? image 1359×878 78.5 KB
The image shows instructions for "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools."  It encourages skipping reading material if you know the answers, checking and saving work regularly, and allows reloading. It explicitly states that any resource, including the internet, ChatGPT, or even hacking, can be used. Finishing under 2 hours suggests success, and scoring above 8/10 promises a high grade.
wow, thats so true…
The image is a yellow emoji face tilted to the side, laughing hysterically.  The eyes are closed, represented by two angled lines.  A wide, open mouth reveals teeth and a pink tongue. Large, blue teardrops are streaming down from the eyes, indicating intense amusement.
