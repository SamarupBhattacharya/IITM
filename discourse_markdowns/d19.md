One question of my GA1 is not working because my API Key Does not have Quota please increase it. As I am a old student of TDS.
@23f1002997 Everyone gets the same daily limit. Please refer to this: github.com GitHub - sanand0/aipipe: Gives anyone access to an OpenAI/OpenRouter API... Gives anyone access to an OpenAI/OpenRouter API key free at 10 cents/week. Self-hostable. Useful as a backend if you're building pure front-end LLM apps (typically $1 per 7 days). So use carefully crafted (pre tested) code snippets only, and do not run multiple requests if you already had a successful request made. Store the response and reuse the stored response for further tests. Kind regards
