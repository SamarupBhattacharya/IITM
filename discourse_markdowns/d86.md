No no sir, I can send you an SS of my code, it’s very much there sir, the tasksA file, i really don’t know why this happened. image 2160×3840 1.92 MB
The image shows a Visual Studio Code window with a Python project structure. It includes common files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt`, along with Python executables and configuration files. The Python extension is currently loading, as indicated in the status bar.
Same issue with me also
Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container. Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error. FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

@carlton good afternoon sir, I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20. Thank you sir
What to do now sir ? Is there no way to fix this now ? I can change the docker file and overwrite the docker image if you allow me to do so.

The image is a meme about software development. The top text states, "When you cannot refactor the code because of a tight deadline." The bottom text shows a poorly built stadium where a section looks like it was haphazardly attached, implying that in software, features are sometimes built fast instead of well because of deadlines.
Figure out the problem in our script and do a pull request to it, we will fix it if it’s a valid bug. Jivraj: Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions. Line number 81 of your app.py subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True) which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.
@Jivraj @carlton I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures. Thanks and Regards
I haven’t received any mails regarding the tds project 1 please look into my concern @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
Sir please consider a re-evaluation for me, please :’)
Please consider my situation a peer whos results were exactly same as mine has received 9, then how could I get 1 . 23f1002630 this is my role number please reconsider @carlton @Jivraj
Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs. Thank You. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
I had built the project well on my Mac OS machine. I am very disappointed with the scores. How do i make amends for revaluation as I feel the code ran well for all tasks on my machine. Please give written steps for revaluation.
Its saying that my evaluation log file is missing, i submitted everything properly. It also says no module named TasksA is found while i got 9/10 marks in the tasksA evaluation script. Kindly look into this, i worked really harrd for this project, @carlton @Jivraj
@22f3000935 Page Not Found | Docker Hub you submitted this docker url through form response for project1, this repo doesn’t exists on docker.
@Jivraj sir please tell me whats the issue am very confused and worried
We are aware about such mistakes and we are looking into it. We will reevaluate those images.
If evaluation file is missing for anyone, we will reevaluate it once more and send same through email. Can you fill form for architecture detection.
Also please , kindly share evaluation log file after execution
