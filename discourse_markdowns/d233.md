TechInsight Analytics uses Hacker News to analyze technology trends. They automate the process of finding relevant posts using the HNRSS API, filtering by topic and engagement. The task is to use the API to find the latest Hacker News post mentioning WebRTC with at least 30 points and provide its link, but the given link is incorrect.
Hi, For the 4th question, We can get the necessary information issueDate and its description from Summary itself right? or am I seeing the stuff in the wrong place?
Change it manually. add the expected answer
when you press ctrl+c it turns off the server and same goes for refresh. also you dont need to manually write ?country… just write till outline and turn on the server n you are good to go.
ok this is fine for now and its showing correct also but at the time of evaluation will my server runs??
It is written in the ques to get the link in the link tag. Not the post link.  Like this image 1464×560 115 KB
The image displays an XML feed from Hacker News focused on "LLM". An item titled "DoppelBot: Replace Your CEO with an LLM" links to an article about using Modal.com for Slack fine-tuning. The item's description includes article and comment URLs, points, comment count, publication date, creator, and a unique identifier.
Thank you bro, I will try this
not at all. your last saved marks will be considered
just replace value instead of it. same problem I also that time I check code and modify serval time I faced same error. so just ignore it and replace expected value instead of actual value in our Json.
extract the pdf to markdown format using chatgpt then add links,tables and one blockquote
Try to use the key ‘enhancedWeatherDescription’ parsing through the summary object (or) use the BeautifulSoup to find ‘div’ with attributes of class: wr-day-summary
Hi, please  ensure that your repository is public, if private the response would be 404. If workflow runs is not found, it might be that the number of API calls to your profile/repo might have exceeded, it usually gets reset at the end of the day. Please try again after sometime)
In question 1 i am getting this error {
    "id": "tt21227864",
    "title": "2. You're Cordially Invited",
    "year": "2025",
    "rating": "5.5"
  } my answer is in above format i tried changing to “2024-”, "2024- " to number tried after reloading the page but still i am getting Error: At [11].year: Values don’t match. Expected: “2024”. Actual: "2024– "
You have to manually change these thing from actual change to expected. For me, error was almost 10 times.
on your 11th or 12th instance change it write the actual value
If you have submitted on the assignment site and saved it in time, then that score is the actual score and will be updated directly on the student dashboard.
Your answer is correct. Just add a space after the hyphen—it will resolve the problem. Or you can copy and paste from here: '2025– '.
