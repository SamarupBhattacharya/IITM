Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube
We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it. Kind regards
The image shows a yellow circular emoji face. It is winking with its left eye closed and its right eye open. The emoji has a slight smile. It expresses a playful, suggestive, or teasing mood.

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.
I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me. Kind regards
Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping.
I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered. But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this
The image shows a yellow smiley face emoji with a wide, open-mouthed smile, conveying laughter. Above the smile is a browed eye, with a drop of blue sweat on the right, implying a sense of nervousness or being overwhelmed amidst the amusement.

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!
sir only 26feb one is available but session of  roe on 25feb is not available can u please upload it and yeah even live session schedule for this is also not showing .
wanted to know the format ,if its like a oppe or just a graded assignment with time limit .
Will be uploaded sometime by tomorrow. Live schedule is on the calendar, sometimes google calendar can be glitchy. you might have to check your settings and make sure you have subscribed to the right calendar
What all weeks are included in ROE??
Modules 1 to 5 is the syllabus for ROE. We will do a final run down of the topics on a special (highly recommended) friday session (will be scheduled shortly). Kind regards
Mock ROE-1 & Mock ROE-2 sessions have not yet been uploaded in YouTube yet @carlton . Can you please upload both these videos at the earliest so that we could prepare from those videos. Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks!
The recordings of these sessions are already available. Mock 1 Mock 2 They are all available in the calendar image 541×678 45.1 KB
The image displays details for a "Live Session - TDS" scheduled weekly on Tuesdays from February 25th to April 8th, 2025, 8:00-10:00pm.  Participants can join via Google Meet or phone. The guest list is hidden, but a YouTube playlist link is provided. The session was created by se2002@study.iitm.ac.in.
do we have the Mock-ROE today?
@carlton image 1284×729 51.3 KB Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?
The image presents two patent-related questions. The first question (Q1) asks to identify patents with the highest number of claims from a given dataset, citing the Patent ID. If multiple patents have the same maximum number of claims, list all IDs separated by commas without spaces. The second question (Q2) is not stated. Both questions prompt users to either start coding or generate a solution with AI.
@23f2004837 Yes its available in the first post of this page, as well in email and online seek portal.
@trebhuvansb There is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all questions
@carlton How many questions will we be having in our ROE? Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE
It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried. Kind regards
