Hi everyone, Deadline for filling discrepency form : 2025-04-13T18:29:00Z We have sent an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you have received a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them. Link to discrepency form(multiple submissions are allowed) : http://64.227.131.20:4200/ Please use official student email address only. Kind regards, TDS Team
I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future . If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities It will be really helpful if you can access the project My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final My vercel link is - https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/

Sir, I filled the form within 30 minutes of receiving the mail. I filled it twice, once for GA5 marks and once for ET marks, but since there was no category for ET, I just chose GA1 as category. Was my query received? Thanks Regards, Shivaditya
Sir, won’t partial marks be awarded for this?
