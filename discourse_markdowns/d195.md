Hi @Algsoch I have checked your dataset along with your params, and its perfectly correct. Try again and check your step. Otherwise go and watch 18-Feb Live Session
@Saransh_Saini Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue. Now we are struggling with Q8. MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error : At root: Array length mismatch Reason :  below query checking only 1st comment ( $[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st. But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error. WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC; Kindly check if any issue with Q8. May be my query is wrong or may be not. Thankyou
@lakshaygarg654 Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
... Then the final layer of the nest ...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards
Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight)
sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch
@daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results. If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right? Thats why you are getting the error. Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results. Kind regards
Thank you for your response @carlton . You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including: json_extract : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_each : “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_extract_path_text : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8 . Thankyou
@lakshaygarg654 This might help DuckDB Unnesting Examples Unnest a list, generating 3 rows (1, 2, 3): SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]); Unnesting a struct, generating two columns (a, b): SELECT unnest({'a': 42, 'b': 84}); Recursive unnest of a list of structs: SELECT unnest([{'a': 42, 'b': 84}, {'a': 100,...

The image is a yellow circular emoji with a friendly and playful expression. It features one eye open and the other winking, suggesting a lighthearted or flirty tone. The emoji also has a soft, curved smile, conveying a sense of amusement and good humor.

The image shows a simple, minimalistic design. It consists of two bright yellow shapes against a solid black background. One shape is a larger, slightly blurred circle, and adjacent to it is a smaller, elongated shape, resembling a capsule or an oval. The composition is basic and focuses on the contrast between the bright yellow and the dark background.

A stark, minimalist image presents a vibrant yellow circle connected to a smaller, rounded rectangle on its right side, all set against a solid black backdrop. The geometric shapes are clean and bold, creating a simple yet striking contrast.
lakshaygarg654: I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8 . Nope no issues with portal for Q8
Here's a summary of the image:

The image shows a man wearing a white shirt and a dark blazer. He appears to be clean-shaven and has short, dark hair. He's looking directly at the camera with a slight smile. The background is plain and light, likely a wall.

Thanks @carlton I found the correct query.
I am still getting the answer as incorrect, though the answer for my dataset : 1187 (951+236) is correct. Would you be able to check again please?
@23ds2000092 Can you just logout and login and reload your GA? (maybe clear cookies and cache) Because I get the correct answer for your GA. Kind regards
Done. it works now. thanks!
{5C759A23-7CA1-4955-9D41-41F8E33D28E2} 830×785 51.9 KB In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in the US (which may be spelled in different ways). However, when I filter in Excel for US and Theta , there are no entries for Sales and Cost . But 0 as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect. (I cross-checked this using GPT.)
RetailWise Inc. needs help cleaning up a messy Excel sheet with 1,000 sales transactions. The task involves standardizing data formats (dates, country names), extracting product names, cleaning sales/cost values, and filtering by date, product ("Theta"), and country (US). Finally, the total margin must be calculated using `(Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales`.
@23f2004313 US is also called United States United States of America USA These are all valid references to US Kind regards
I have replaced all the different names of US (all ) as “US” . also sorted the dates as asked in the question .
I have checked your GA and I do get sales entries for the criteria in your GA. Please remember that this module is about data cleaning. And that data needs to be sanitised before you start filtering. Kind regards
@carlton Sir , I have tried reconstructing the image in ques 10 multiple times and even still the output shows error: image pixels do not match…how can I fix this? reconstructed 500×500 62.3 KB Edit: I got it correct
The image depicts a futuristic cityscape at night, glowing with bright neon lights. Sleek skyscrapers pierce the sky, while elevated highways crisscross the city, illuminated with moving vehicle lights. Flying vehicles also navigate the airspace, enhancing the city's advanced, high-tech feel.
i am also facing the same problem and i have cross verified the pixels but it is still showing the same
Now my answer is same and correct i think problem was in TDS matching question like it was matched to other number now programmer correct it and matched to correct value like 4764
