Hello Sir, There is a difference in score between the total score I received in mail vs the dashboard. The Dashboard score is wrong and needs to be corrected. Please rectify the mistake. image 1640×1316 59.1 KB image 778×1088 111 KB @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Thanks and Regards
This is an email regarding official scores for "Tools in Data Science." It lists scores for GA1-GA7 (-1 means absent), Project 1 & 2, Remote Online Exam, and End Term. Bonus details and the T Score calculation are provided. The email prompts learners to use a linked discrepancy form if they find any issues with their scores.
The image shows a grade report for a "Tools in Data Science" course.  Assignments averaged 100%, and the student was allowed to take the end term exam, scoring 73.00.  However, the final course score was 60.00, resulting in a grade letter of "C".
Even I noticed the same error in the dashboard when compared to my original score @carlton @Jivraj
Apparently its an issue from the opperational team, they have informed them. hopefully it changes soon
The image shows a yellow, round emoji face. Its eyes are closed tightly and its mouth is open in an expression that suggests sadness or despair. Large, cartoonish blue tears stream down its face from both eyes, emphasizing the overwhelming feeling of sorrow or being distraught.

Operations have corrected it. Please confirm. Kind regards
