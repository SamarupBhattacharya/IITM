@carlton Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn’t help as much because the highest marks were 16.
Normalisation is only helpful when no one scores the top marks.
It will be similar in case the top cumulative score after the ET is, say, 90… @carlton
@Saransh_Saini @carlton Please can you tell me whether my evaluation is done or not. For roll no: 22f2000946 If yes, I will stop my VM. I am running low on credits.
We will complete evaluation in two days. We will also send out a mail today for those whose evaluation has been completed
sir i am unable to work with other things on my laptop image 712×574 6.41 KB because laptop giving error because my system ran out of memory and because api working continuously more than 1 week
The image displays a browser error message "Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage". The error code is specified as "Out of Memory," suggesting the browser ran out of memory while attempting to load or display the webpage. The message includes a "Learn more" link. A pixelated icon of a broken file folder is at the top.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed. Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).
image 2342×990 233 KB Hello @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec , I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error , As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only , I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess does it means , my LLM failed ?? Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work , You can check its working from interface too Please check once !!
The image shows Vercel function logs and invocation details. A Python 3.12 function named `/main.py` in Washington D.C. experienced a Gateway Timeout (504) after running for 10 seconds, using 214MB of memory. Logs show email updates and a failed workflow trigger due to "bad credentials" error (401) during deployment in production environment.
We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on. I apologise for the late reply, we ran into some unforeseen problems, hence the delay. Thank you for your patience, Kind regards
@carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini Respected Sir, I received an email stating we have to turn on URL endpoint again. I am using free version of NGROK if I want to re-start my application then my NGROK URL  will change and the forms are closed. What Should I do ? this is urgent.
@Saransh_Saini @carlton sir today I received this email image 1408×305 10.9 KB I have did not turned it off it is just that the first request take time of 50 to 60 sec as you can see in the image. image 1842×974 33.9 KB and it also take same time in linux image 965×175 6.84 KB Please allow some time for my server hosted on Render to initialize, as it may take a moment to become fully active. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
This announcement informs learners that server endpoint checks for TDS Project 2 are ongoing, and they should turn their servers back on if they were previously turned off.  They apologize for the inconvenience, are aware of credit usage on platforms like Azure, and will notify users when evaluations are complete.
The image displays a Postman request. It's a POST request with an empty Query Params. The response body, formatted as JSON, shows "answer": "140". The request was successful (Status 200 OK), took 53.13 seconds, and the response size was 361 bytes.  Headers show (12).
The image shows a terminal command using `curl` to send a POST request to an API endpoint. The request includes a question prompting the user to evaluate a Google Sheets formula (SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10))). The API responds with the answer "140" in JSON format.
Just reply to the email that I have sent to you regarding your query. We will make exceptions for students facing this issue of having a changed end point due to the way ngrok works. Kind regards
Humble Request to Update API Request Link Dear Team, I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request. Previous API Request Link: project2llm-production.up.railway.app IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI Correct API Request Link: https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, Pratyush Pulak Nishhank
The image shows a circular teal icon with a white, stylized letter "F" inside. The "F" resembles a lightning bolt or a forward-pointing arrow with a sharp, angular design. The simple, minimalist design suggests a focus on speed, technology, or forwarding motion.

Thank you for considering it also one question sir, how long do I have to keep it running ?
But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60% We have learned so many things  and try to implement in it too,… Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much because projects hold the major chunk in grading @carlton
Agree with this sentiment. Hope there are bonus points for participation in discourse as well.
@carlton i submitted incorrect api request link my correct api link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/post_ask_question is it possible to change some how…
suppose i have resolved the hosting issue that the link i provided had now , will u still evaluate as i fixed the issue in response to the email i received on 8th april?
Sir, @Jivraj can I know how long do I need to keep the server running ? Roll No. 22f200559
It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer. If I run it on my computer, it will redirect to my port 8000 if it is running.
