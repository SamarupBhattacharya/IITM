@Jivraj Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image: Open Squoosh and load the image In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2). The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes image 398×570 17.5 KB I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below. image 384×707 21.6 KB
This image shows an interface for editing and compressing images. Options include resizing, reducing the color palette, and compressing using OxiPNG. The user has selected a compression effort level of 2, resulting in a 63% reduction in file size to 1.41 kB. A download button is also visible.

The image displays an "Edit" menu, likely for image editing. "Resize" and "Reduce palette" are off. The "Compress" section is expanded, using "WebP" with lossless compression. The effort level is set to 9, slight loss to 0. "Discrete tone image" and "Preserve transparent data" are unchecked. The compression is expected to reduce the size by 83%, resulting in a 630B file size. A download icon is visible.
@Jivraj Hello Sir, I was able to submit the correct response now. Please consider this as solved (unless anyone else is facing similar issue)

The image displays instructions for using Llamafile, including downloading a model and creating an ngrok tunnel. It prompts for the ngrok URL but shows an error message: "Response is not valid JSON: error code 524" when a URL is entered. "Check" and "Save" buttons are visible below the error.
for the fast api question, would there be an issue if i am using code spaces my url would  look like https://symmetrical-space-cod-wrrjw5rw6xv7hvj9p-8000.app.github.dev/api @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Error is TypeError: Failed to fetch Screenshot 2025-01-26 184204 1661×452 47.1 KB I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public
The image describes an API endpoint requiring a "class" query parameter. The API should filter students by class, returning results in CSV file order. CORS needs enabling. The user input an endpoint, but the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" message indicates a problem retrieving data from the provided URL. The system plans to test the URL with a "?class=" parameter.

for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though Screenshot 2025-01-26 204950 897×267 20.4 KB
The image shows instructions for running a Llamafile model and creating a tunnel to the server using ngrok. It asks for the ngrok URL, providing a sample format. The response input is blacked out, but it's indicated as "Correct."

@23f1002382 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards
The image is a title card for an animated video explaining network ports. It displays common port numbers alongside their corresponding services such as FTP (21), SSH (22), and HTTPS (443).  A stylized computer and server rack are pictured, visually connecting the port information to network devices. The title aims to demystify the concept of ports using animation.
The image depicts the concept of a firewall. A hacker, represented by a figure with a laptop, attempts to send malicious data (skulls) through a red brick firewall. The title "Firewall Explained" suggests an informational context about security measures against cyber threats.

The image compares Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers. On the left, there are several Virtual Machine setups with email, webserver, and database elements on a simulated desktop. On the right, a server rack displays containers, labeled as applications, with monitoring displays, also showing the containers are also labeled 'container'. The text "VMS vs CONTAINERS ANIMATED" is prominently displayed.
thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir
Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again. Can you clarify why this is happening?
because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” Kind regards
hi @23f2003853 I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of 127.0.0.1 . Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.
Hello Sir, I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same. image 858×234 14.2 KB Thanks and Regards Shalini
The image shows an error related to a Vercel URL setup. The system expects a specific sequence of numbers, `[73,73,53,63,61]`, but receives a different sequence, `[73,53,61,63,73]`, indicating a configuration problem. Enabling CORS for GET requests is also suggested. The prompt asks for the correct Vercel URL in the format `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.
Hi Shalini, I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend. Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct. Kind regards Jivraj
image 871×900 40.7 KB Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?
This Python code defines a handler for HTTP requests, specifically GET and OPTIONS. It handles CORS by setting appropriate headers. For GET requests, it loads JSON data, parses a 'name' query parameter, and returns corresponding 'marks' from the loaded data in JSON format. If the name isn't found or is missing, it returns an error message. The OPTIONS method handles preflight CORS requests.
Till yesterday I was able to login ngrok. But today it shows some error image 1366×768 69.7 KB can anyone guide me to fix it
The image shows a web page for ngrok's device activation, requiring a code. An error message indicates that the information provided for MFA verification was invalid. The user entered a code (4VZTALOCF43MBSGDR63ZL7THHK4BO6I3), but the system rejected it. There is also a prompt to activate windows.

The image provides instructions for using a Llamafile model. It starts by directing the user to download the Llamafile and run it. The next step instructs the user to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok. The image displays an example of what the ngrok URL might look like and shows the actual URL that has been created.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Sir I am getting this “TypeError: Load failed” for Q9 inspite of getting proper responses in “ http://127.0.0.1:8000/api ”, cors is also enabled. Please help me with this, I am finding it difficult to circumvent this. Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 10.08.58 PM 2618×366 47 KB 2 2234×188 34.4 KB
The image shows a prompt asking for the API URL endpoint for FastAPI, suggesting an example like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. An input box contains the incomplete URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ap`. The displayed error "TypeError: Load failed" suggests a problem with the entered URL or its availability. The system will test the URL by appending a query parameter. Also there is a CORS requirement for GET requests.
The image shows a browser window displaying JSON data. The JSON structure represents a list of students, where each student has a "studentId" and a "class" attribute set to "1A". The URL in the address bar is "127.0.0.1", suggesting it's a local server serving the data.
After checking few times now i started getting below error please help image 1348×352 21.4 KB
The instructions show the user to download Llamafile, run the specified model, and create an ngrok tunnel to the Llamafile server. The user has input a potential ngrok URL, but an error is displayed: "Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This indicates a problem with the server's response format.
Screenshot 2025-01-30 024723 2634×1189 196 KB Please anyone who have done these kindly guide me. As in Q6 i am unable to fetch values it is giving null all time. and in Q9 how can I use class as variable name ?
This coding problem requires creating a Python API on Vercel that retrieves student marks. The API should return a JSON response with the marks for provided student names, enabling CORS. The provided Vercel URL is incorrect, resulting in an error; the expected response doesn't match the returned null values.
