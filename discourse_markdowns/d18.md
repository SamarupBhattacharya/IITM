This image shows the modules section of an online course from IIT Madras in May 2025. Modules include topics such as Course Introduction, Disciplinary Conduct, Development Tools, Deployment Tools, and Project 1.  "Graded Assignment 1" is highlighted, indicating it is a part of Module 1.
Hi @23ds2000044 : Regarding assignment status in the portal. The assignment status can only be seen in the tds site and it is not linked to the main course portal. So the submission status will not be seen there.
