@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini These are my new endpoints: https://gasolver-hgayefe7b0avhpc6.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api/ I have replied to the email regarding the re-evaluation message that was sent to me. Since I deleted the Azure Web Service Plan after receiving instructions from the TDS team to stop the service, I now need to host it again .Please let me know the next steps.
Greetings, @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project. please use this api url -: https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/ instead of this - https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/ Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Rahul Pathak 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
@Pritul_raut , @22f3001416 Start server locally and send us your ngrok url’s.
@rahul_pathak12 @JerinJohn01 Please fill the form below we will only pick your endpoints from there, we won’t be picking from discourse posts. accounts.google.com Google Forms: Sign-in Access Google Forms with a personal Google account or Google Workspace account (for business use).
Hi @all Please use the form that is sent. We will consider it if you send it as soon as possible. Please note that this is still at our discretion. We will try to consider everyones endpoint who submit on this form only. https://forms.gle/m2pzirzGvphPB5zq8
Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 1000063856 1920×858 139 KB
The image shows a Windows PowerShell terminal output from a data science tool. The tool processes questions using Python files located in different directories (GA1, GA2, GA3). It logs IP addresses accessing the /api/ endpoint and provides scores and confidence levels for the processed files. There are logs with user using OpenAI, GitHub and excel.
How long you want us to keep timeout of request is, right now we have 60 seconds of timeout.
@carlton @Jivraj I have received 5 “200 OK” POST requests on my ngrok endpoint(which i had sent replying to @Jivraj email before 10:30 PM) between 11:02 PM to 11:05 PM. Do i need to update my previous gform? Or is everything done from my end? Im keeping server on till tomorrow morning.
@carlton yes sir same doubt as @GaURaVinDeX . i also got 5 200 ok requests in my terinal. i sent the url to the mail i got before. do i need to update this gform again? or  Or is everything done from my end? I m keeping server on till tomorrow morning.
If you filled the gform that is sufficient.
sir i replied for the mail i recieved for new ngrok link. so now you are asking to fill this gform sir?
If you filled the gform before its fine. Its for all those that had accidently gave us wrong ones.
Sir, I replied to the email received by me from @jivraj as it was instructed. Should i fill gform now also?
Email to jivraj for ngrok was fine. Since he emailed you directly for the ngrok folks
Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to @Jivraj before 10:30 PM is current active. So i conclude our emailed ngrok endpoints of today to @Jivraj are enough.
Yes todays ngrok you sent to jivraj is fine. Because old ones are invalid
@carlton Please recheck my project 2 also as I got 0 on dashboard. I and my two friends made this together but he got 80 and I got 0, how is this possible?
Sir, submitted the gform and also replied to the mail that I received about re-evaluation
sir , I got 39 with project 2 score as 0. Will fail by 1 mark if my project 2  is 0. haha…
You did not provide the right endpoint. Did you fill the form with the right endpoint.
