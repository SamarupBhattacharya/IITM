No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students. But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged. @24f2007378
thank you, got one extra answer because of this.
Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and really very difficult but interesting exam.
Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used. But, I want to  thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA’s efforts in last week.  Take care Regards, Harsha
I tried many times for correlation question. using numoy, excel, writing explicit function. for all the three, i got -0.7144 as the answer. but the portal showed incorrret.
Challenging ROE. Definitely should’ve studied more

Screenshot (92) 1920×1080 352 KB @carlton @Saransh_Saini Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code: from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000) here are the responses: INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

The image shows a coding exam interface on the left and a Thunder Client IDE on the right, testing a FastAPI proxy server.  The exam task requires the server to fetch data from a given URL, adding a CORS header. The IDE is making a GET request to the local server's API, and a 200 OK status code indicates a successful response. However, the exam interface is reporting "Incorrect response."
thanks a ton @carlton and to all the TAs. Performed much better in ROE than I expected!!
ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.
Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573 But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.
Hello Sir"s, @carlton @Saransh_Saini I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm. My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal. I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode Kind Regards, Muthu

Hi @Muthupalaniappan We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it and figuring out what all we can do.
Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once rounded off, i would taken as correct
Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly… As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two. image 940×568 36.4 KB I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life. Please consider accepting my submission Thanks so much and best regards,

The Python script uses `tabula-py` to extract tables from a PDF file named `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf`. The necessary libraries are already installed. Warnings indicate font substitutions due to missing fonts. The extracted data is shown, containing subjects (Maths, Physics, English, Economics, Biology) with numerical values and a "Group" column, all as `int64` data types.
The image shows a question asking for the total biology marks of students in groups 1-28 who scored 30 or more marks in maths. An answer of "34919" has been entered, but the response is marked as "Incorrect. Try again."
