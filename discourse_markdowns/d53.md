We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline. Hope that answers your question.
The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.
in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline. Also the before deadline one end point is /api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')
gform allows multiple submissions. i would have to check with @s.anand if its been enabled, i almost certain he has configured it for multiple submissions.
I understand your point but what I am saying is that when I edited my end point after deadline it changed my timestamp to after deadline one so that is my concern that my submission might not be even considered
you can have multiple submissions with multiple timestamps in gform. (unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens).
I have edited after deadline from /api to /api/ I did not resubmit
: From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents —they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir, I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart. I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications. Thank you for your understanding
Hi @carlton The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini . It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses. We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team. Thank you Lakshay
Dear @carlton @s.anand Sir “I’ve deployed my project to Microsoft Azure through GitHub, and my Azure for Students account was verified today. Could you kindly review this project instead of the previous link I shared? While I did not make any changes to the code, you can access and review it directly on GitHub.”
My Azure credits are burning out. It is giving me unwanted pressure. Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 2.13.30 PM 2458×1180 207 KB Please evalute the project early. we can help in writing evaluation script, that also would be a learning for us. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Dear Sir @carlton , Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline. So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case? Sir, please throw some light on my doubt. Warm Regards, Tensed TDS Student
@carlton . Hi sir, I also edited the form after deadline. I just added /ask in the end…
any update on this would be appreciated @carlton @Jivraj
I would like to clarify something, I had gotten a couple of get requests on my ngrok api endpoint .(but I had set it up for post req as per the P2 details) .Wanted to know if this is requests from ur side. Thank you
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-04-05 232353 1758×564 57.8 KB something’s cooking… And it doesn’t seem like good news for us — at least from the initial visuals.
The image displays a log from a "TDS python" process, showing HTTP requests made to a server.  Many requests return "404 Not Found" errors, particularly for paths like "/.env" and "/.git/config", suggesting probing for sensitive files.  Other requests return "200 OK", indicating successful retrieval. Some also get "405 Method Not Allowed" error, indicating that the request method used is not allowed.
The image shows a "Grinning Face with Sweat" emoji. It features a bright yellow face with wide, smiling eyes and a broad open-mouthed grin. A single, prominent drop of blue sweat is visible on the upper right side of the face. This emoji typically conveys nervousness, relief, or awkwardness.

@carlton I’m noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs—mostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure—targeting sensitive paths like /t4 , /logincheck , /.env , and /.git/config . These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??
Several students have made the exact same problem. We are looking into it.
The evaluation script is ready and the evaluations are going on. So have no worries, your $75 are enough to carry out several evaluations.
