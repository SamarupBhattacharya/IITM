The image shows instructions for GitHub workflow creation, specifying its location in the `.github/workflows/` directory and suggesting to trigger, wait, and verify the workflow. An invalid repository URL, `https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows`, is entered, resulting in a `YAMLParseError` indicating formatting issues in line 1.
The image shows an error message after entering a GitHub repository URL. The URL entered is "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows". The error states that no executed job step matches the email address "23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", likely indicating a problem authenticating or finding associated job data for the user. A "Check" button is visible below the error message.
The submission is on the Actual assignment page like for all the previous GAs in TDS. This is the ONLY valid submission button for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5. Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10.43.15 am 1390×1146 113 KB

Thank you  for your help , my repo was not public before and can you also help me in g4 i got this “Error: At root: Property name mismatch”
In g4 which Question have that error you are getting
In the last two question of the ga,it is mentioned including both groups.so what is the meaning of this . image 1622×601 85.5 KB @Jivraj @carlton
The task involves extracting student marks from a PDF table using parsing libraries, cleaning the data by converting marks to numerical types, filtering to identify students with Physics scores of 17+ in groups 43-66, and calculating the total Biology marks for this cohort. This automation enables informed decisions and efficient resource allocation for Greenwood High School.

Hi Tushar, If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation. kind regards
Question 4 " Sample output { “25-02-04”: “Sunny intervals and light winds”, “25-02-05”: “Light rain and light winds”, } Error: At root: Property name mismatch"
Hi, even i’m facing the same issue, image 1564×715 34.2 KB image 1916×882 65.1 KB image 1605×320 26.5 KB @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton Can anyone please help to fix this issue and submit this correctly.
The image shows the GitHub Actions page for a repository named "TDS_GA_4".  Specifically, it displays the details of "Daily Commit #10", which was triggered manually 16 hours ago. The action completed successfully in 18 seconds. It involves the "daily-commit.yml" workflow, and the "daily-commit" job took 7 seconds.

This GitHub interface displays the `daily-commit.yml` workflow file within the `TDS_GA_4` repository.  The workflow is configured to run automatically at 00:00 UTC daily. It sets up git configuration, creates a file named `daily-commit.txt` with the message "This is an automated daily commit", and commits changes. The code's writing was sped up by 55% using GitHub Copilot.
The image displays a workflow setup process, advising to trigger, await completion, ensure it's the most recent action, and verify commits within 5 minutes.  A GitHub repository URL is entered, however, an error message indicates that no executed job step matches the user.

21f3002277: Set up Git user (23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) Still the same error appears
The image shows a blurred, white letter "V" against a solid blue background. The "V" appears to be slightly luminous or glowing, contrasting with the matte blue backdrop. The overall effect is simple, abstract, and visually clean due to the limited elements and color palette.

Thanks for providing clarification Sir
I am also facing same issue can’t resolve.
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API, I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai) and post that also mapped each issueDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription . The sample output mentioned was: The output would look like this: {
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
} And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was) { “2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-09”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-10”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-11”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-12”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-13”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-14”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-15”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-16”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-17”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-18”: “A clear sky and light winds”, “2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds” } But it’s giving Error:: Error: At root: Different number of properties Can you please help how to fix this issue.
Issue resolved for me after following below step After creating the workflow: Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete Ensure it appears as the most recent action in your repository Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run
In place of “name: Setup up GIT config” change to “name: add commit {your_email}”
use this Google Colab with the city name to get the Json Body just change the date format. @23f2004752
