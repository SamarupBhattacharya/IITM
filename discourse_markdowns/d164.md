Sir i have missed the submission deadline  by 5  minutes, can you give permission for the google form to accept the response for half an hour more.
Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.
Sir can you please allow submission for 5 more minutes?

@s.anand @carlton Dear Sir, I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly. I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated. I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long. I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback. Thank you for considering my heartfelt request. Sincerely, Rishit Jain (24F2004595)
Although couldn’t complete handling every task, but really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot throughout the process. I appreciate the opportunity to work on such an engaging project. For Project 2, I’ll make sure to allocate sufficient time and approach it with even greater commitment.
Sorry @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.
Just push the latest image to docker asap. Hopefully the team considers it.
True. Same here. Just giving 2 days for this project was definitely a big mistake on my part… but I couldn’t really give more time due to work commitments.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly. I am not 100% sure but i guess i used “ii” instead of “i” in “thevixhal/tdsvishal”… is there any way to check this ?
Can the submissions open just for some time? In minutes? Many students did silly mistakes due toh nervousness, we can just correct it.
I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do. Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?
@s.anand @carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over. I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc. Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository. I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely. my github repo : GitHub - 21f3001076/TDS_Project_1: This is IITM Data Science TDS Course Project 1 Repository Thankyou Lakshay student id: 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
Dear @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj , Thank you so much for this wonderful project! We have learned so many things from this experience, especially the power of prompts. The team has put in tremendous effort, extending a few sessions and patiently clearing all our doubts. We truly appreciate the dedication and support Regards, Arjun
I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated. I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks very much again for your guidance and support. Regards, Swati
Thanks for your compliments Swati. It’s always nice to know our efforts paid off. Happy Learning

I have received a mail that my project has ""No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile " which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project.
WOMP WOMP should i call a wambulance?
