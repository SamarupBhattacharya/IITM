The image displays a timetable dated March 2nd, 2025, for courses Python A1, Python A2, Java, and TDS ROE. Python A1 and A2 share the same timing (09:30 AM to 11:30 AM) as Java (09:30 AM to 11:00 AM). TDS ROE is scheduled from 01:00 PM to 01:45 PM. The exam links for the Python and Java are closed and a link for TDS ROE is provided. All timings are in IST.  It is mentioned that Seeya is integrated with Google Chrome.
waiting for the quickest 45 min… based on previous GA , i might solve 1 ~ 2 questions.
the questions will be available from 1 onwards?
@carlton The link uploaded on https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html for TDS ROE might be incorrect…
Gmeet link is for support and collaboration. You can raise technical issues in gmeet so we can help you . No proctoring for ROE
can we use ai for coding help
maybe finding the correct exam link is also a part of the exam?

The image shows a gray tabby cat sitting on a laptop, with its paws on the keyboard. A red computer mouse sits nearby. The cat is looking intently at the screen, suggesting curiosity or amusement. The warm lighting and cozy setting create a playful and relatable scene.

The image shows a yellow smiley face emoji. It has simple features: two round, dark brown eyes and a gently curved, smiling mouth. The overall expression conveyed is positive, happy, and friendly. The emoji is circular and shaded to give a 3D appearance.

sir help i tried in incognito as well
The exam link is working now.
were you able to resolve it ?
Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.
HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT. JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button??
Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.
