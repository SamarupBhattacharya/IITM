It was named wrongly. You named it LICENCE but it should be LICENSE or LICENSE.md.
But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark) that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after 12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier: image 1850×1021 132 KB

Hi @23f2002600 @21f1005908 Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science You can take it up with @s.anand I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. 

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. 

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…

Runned for you, it A1 Fails.
Your docker image and github repo are not consistent,  your docker image was not built with the latest code before 18th feb that’s present in your github repo.
We can’t consider any changes after deadline.
Your docker image and github repo are not consistent. While running docker image we got following error: flask module missing For regenerating this error follow steps mentioned in below post. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment:

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.
In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps).
I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image. Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems. LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.
@carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.
Sir but i did test my project via evaluate.py and got the 8/10 in my tasks A. A simple port error has resulted in no evaluation at all after all the hardwork.
Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.
Dear Sir, I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else. Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far. With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.
Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056 I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards
Hi @carlton , I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below). image 1124×268 9.8 KB Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!

@carlton , I followed all the steps instead of curl -LO https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/archive/<commit_sha>.zip unzip <path to downloaded zipped repo> , I used git clone .
@carlton @Jivraj Not able to see the my id in 22f3002723 in evaluation logs or docker logs.. just curious if there was  any issues in creating the image out of github ?
Thanks for the fixes (I have updated the code now). It was put together quickly and not tested before we actually posted it.
