} @Jivraj @carlton i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error. what to do? i have added the cors in the app.py file as well from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS


app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)


@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run() https://student-marks-4vsd75x3f-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api
@23f2003751 While I understand why you might choose to use flask due to your familiarity with it, the http.server library is just very simple to use. The only extra line of code you would need inside your get request if you used the http.server library would be: self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*") Try to rewrite your code using http.server library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy. The boilerplate code for a get request using the http.server library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm. Kind regards
In GA-2 Q6, Q9 and Q10 answers are not getting accepted on my device(Mac book air) but when I am executing the same thing from my friends device(windows 11 pro) it is getting accepted and then when I try to save it from her device and then do the final submission from my my device then again the answers are not getting submitted for the same three questions. @s.anand Sir please help me through this
@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries. The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy Kind regards

The image displays a browser window accessing a Vercel-deployed FastAPI application. The URL includes API parameters "name=IE" and "name=G6k". The response is a JSON-like string, "{"marks": [58,53]}", formatted as "Pretty print" within the browser. This suggests a simple API endpoint returning a list of marks.

@23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return Notice there is no if __name__ == "__main__": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == "__main__": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards
image 697×136 8.17 KB even though its their i don’t know why i am facing this issue anyone please check my git GitHub - NAMAN-BERI/actions
The image shows a form asking for a GitHub repository URL, providing an example format. A URL "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git" has been entered. However, an error message "Error: No runs found" is displayed, suggesting a problem with locating or accessing related runs within the specified repository.
how to create a iitm account in github…i am not getting the username please guide its proceeding like this …for my user name image 594×296 15.8 KB
The image shows a form with fields for "Password" and "Username." The password field has a placeholder. Password requirements are at least 15 characters, or 8 with a number and lowercase letter. The username "navya" is unavailable, but suggestions like "navya-stack" are provided.
Doubt : Should the 3rd question (github) done in the iitm github mail or any of the personal mail ?
Im not able to get the ngrok question correct. I have attached a screenshot Screenshot 2025-01-21 222055 1920×957 262 KB The link is working fine in browser and running the LLM there. @carlton @Jivraj
The image shows instructions for creating a tunnel to a Llamafile server using ngrok and a potential ngrok URL. However, accessing the provided ngrok URL results in an error message indicating "Response is not valid JSON." The error is due to a Cloudflare issue with worker exception and is displaying an HTML error page, rather than a JSON response.
Hi Mishkat, I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted. For example https://tds21jan.vercel.app/ . image 1705×672 56.2 KB kind regards Jivraj
The image shows a Vercel deployment status.  The deployment is at `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` and has two domains. The status is "Ready," created 18 hours ago by `jivraj-18`. A 404 error is indicated, suggesting that the deployment may have issues. The user is prompted to connect a Git repository for production.
Hi Gaurav, This is problem with Cloudflare content delivery service where application is served. Try it out after some time it will work. Kind regards
Hi Divya, You can use any github account, it need not be associated with IITM account.
Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 3.17.12 PM 1440×900 83.3 KB I tried both the url in domain still it is showing failed to fetch
The image shows the Vercel dashboard for project "vercel-ga2", owned by "mishkat02's projects."  It displays the status of a production deployment, indicating it is "Ready" and was created 22 hours ago.  Options to connect Git, view usage, and manage domains are available, along with Build Logs, Runtime Logs, and Instant Rollback features.
Hi NamanBeri, Just remove .git it will work.
[UPDATE 22/02/2025]: GA 2 NEW DEADLINE: 2025-02-02T18:29:00Z
I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community . I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.
Okay,  I’ll try to it again using these methods and let you know Thank you
