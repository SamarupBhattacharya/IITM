@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir, please confirm me whether I have been evaluated or not. Because my azure balance is reducing day by day.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server. However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point. The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405. 1000150868 1080×2340 242 KB I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form. 1000150872 1080×2340 197 KB Thanks Regards, Shivaditya
The image displays logs from a Google Cloud Run service, named "tdsproject2shiva." The logs indicate various server activities, including initialization, requests, and responses, along with associated timestamps. The logs show the application is processing a "pricing question" and making "python-requests" to external URLs. There are also "GET" and "POST" requests being sent to the application.
The image is a screenshot of an email. It asks for the link to an API endpoint. The email provides a GitHub link and an example API endpoint URL.  There's also a message asking if the form looks suspicious, indicating a potential phishing attempt. The user has many unread emails.
@Saransh_Saini @carlton Hello sir, I apologize for bothering you again. About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system’s evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam. i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem image 706×592 10.1 KB
The Python script "uniu.py" identified five unique IP addresses accessing the "/api/" endpoint. It lists each IP, its accessed endpoint ("/api/"), and the number of times it accessed the endpoint. The total number of "/api/" endpoint calls is 262, made by 5 distinct IPs.
I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms. To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message. Please look into this @carlton @Saransh_Saini
I have mistakenly filled tds-project2-final-omega.vercel.app instead of https://tds-project2-final-omega.vercel.app/api/ in gform, i humbly request you to pls accept this . @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini i have filled gform with 23f1002838@ds.study.iitm.ac.in i have filled gform for end point edit i hope this will work
23f2000237: I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint i where did you check it? Also, on https://www.vercel-status.com/ this is showing Update - npm have released a status page incident, and users can monitor further updates here: https://status.npmjs.org Apr 11, 2025 - 03:02 UTC Monitoring - We have observed authentication issues to private registries using npm access tokens. Affected users may see 4xx errors when installing private packages. Manually regenerating tokens appears to resolve this issue. At this time, there is no official statement from npm or GitHub regarding the root cause. Apr 11, 2025 - 02:37 UTC
The image features a single white letter "S" centered against a dark blue-gray background. The "S" is in a simple, clean font and appears to be slightly blurred. The overall composition is minimalistic, focusing solely on the letter and its contrast with the background.

Yes I also got the same email, but when I checked my vercel dashboard I found no such api access. Kindly verify this @Saransh_Saini @carlton
Will we receive scores by today?
Today I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form Here’s my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard: image 402×599 23.3 KB aap link : https://tds-project2-21f3000591.onrender.com
The image displays a student's scores in a "Tools in Data Science" course. The student's weekly assignment scores vary, with some absences. They scored 90.00 on a programming quiz and 5.00 on the first course project. The second course project is marked as absent. The student is allowed to take the End Term Exam. There's a button to go to the course page.
@carlton @Jivraj Dear Sir, In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end. ID: 21f2000304
@carlton @jivraj @saransh_Saini hello sir, in my portal the project 2 score is showing absent even after submitting tds project 2 successfully in google form and keeping the server running all the time, please can you recheck it again, deployment link: https://tds-p2-gun1.onrender.com
@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/ as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?
@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Please look into this, my portal is showing zero marks
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini My portal is showing 0 even no github repo is made so are evalaution even done??? Pls tell
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini On my portal it’s showing that Course Project Score 2 - Absent but I submitted and fill the form also deployed the app successfully.
Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.
Hello Sir, For me as well Project 2 scores are showing 0.I have spent alot of time and effort in this project. Please look into it.
@carlton @Saransh_Saini sir , I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately 50 to 60 seconds to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments. Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link , with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed. Thank you for your support and guidance.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that’s why I made that post(the one to which I’m replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.
Hi sir @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into: Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code , both return 200 OK . Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results. No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly. Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project. I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation. I’ve spent weeks working on this project , including sleepless nights. This is my last term – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma. Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify: API Documentation: FastAPI - Swagger UI API Endpoint: http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that. I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again. as you can see my vm is working fine here vm start 1917×1077 110 KB its running  as you can see here checking ans 1913×1075 65.5 KB POST request through  postman vscode post 1535×1018 36.8 KB GET request through  postman vscode get 1525×1030 38.6 KB my server running on my friends on my friends laptop friend laptop 1600×999 198 KB Thanks, Shashi
