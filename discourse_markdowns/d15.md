Hi Sir, image 1920×1080 248 KB I kept on saving while solving each question in GA-1, My final score was 5.25 which we can find in the above screenshot. But now, when I go to GA-1 and open the site, it is showing my answers but total score at the top is showing “ZERO”. See below. image 1920×1080 142 KB Something strange. Anyone having this issue?
The image shows an online exam question about moving and renaming files, worth 0.5 marks. The task involves downloading a zip file, extracting it, moving files, and renaming them according to specific rules (digit replacement, file name conversion). The correct answer to a `grep` command run on the folder is provided, marked as correct. The next question is about SQLite databases.
The image shows an online assignment for the IIT Madras Degree Program, specifically TDS 2025 May GA1. The task is to write an SQL query to calculate the average order value for "shipped" orders (case-insensitive). The user has input a query, and the assignment deadline has passed with a score of 0.  A WhatsApp notification is also visible.
Check the “Recent saves (most recent is your official score)” section. That should tell you your last saved score.
yes same happend foe me to, my last submission score was 10/10 but now after deadline its showing zero image 621×275 15.3 KB image 970×167 6.05 KB
The image displays a list of recent saves with corresponding scores. It shows three save points, each with a "Reload" option. The saves are dated 5/12/2025 (score: 10), 5/11/2025 (score: 9.5), and 5/11/2025 (score: 9). The note indicates the most recent save's score is the official one.

The image shows a red banner stating that something ended on Sunday, May 18, 2025, at 11:59 PM Indian Standard Time (IST). It also displays a score of 0, and buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save."

I think our last saved score are stored in the backend.And after deadline last saved score posted to course database automatically. Same thing happened for me also.
