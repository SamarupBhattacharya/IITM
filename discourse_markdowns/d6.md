I had submitted the graded assignment within time. However, the score is not reflecting on grades section under TDS course page. Please help. Attaching the screenshot for ref. IMG_0005 1640×2101 195 KB
This is a screenshot of an online quiz page, "exam.sanand.workers.dev." It includes instructions like "Save regularly" and "Use anything."  It states the quiz is "hackable" and provides tips for doing well. The user, 21f1001947@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, is logged in and has recent save scores listed, the highest being 7.25.
I am facing the same issue, maybe we should wait for a while
Screenshot 2025-05-24 at 7.53.20 PM 2124×1308 268 KB The GA 1 scores are got released . Please check ur mails because I got a mail like this.
The email informs a learner about their GA 1 score of 10 for the [TDS Jan 2025] course, mentioning it will soon appear on the dashboard. Solutions will be discussed in live sessions and answers are parameterized, meaning multiple correct approaches exist. No answer key will be provided, but the email lists teaching assistants and instructors for contact.
