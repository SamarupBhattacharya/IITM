Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly? @all
Are we allowed to do that?
Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even  to ask a cat also or a pet, im not sure
Alright, works. I am down to collaborate.
Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.
Sharing answers is asking for help
If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts?
trebhuvansb: Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this. this is valid. should we just ask them? Could u message a TA?
The image features a white, outlined capital letter "T" centered against a solid green background. The white outline gives the letter a subtle, modern feel, and the green background provides a contrasting backdrop that makes the letter stand out. The overall composition is simple and clean.

Yeah thats the idea…
What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? Tools in Data Science @ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…
The image shows a close-up of a man with short, dark hair and glasses. He is looking upwards with a slightly furrowed brow, suggesting he's pondering or thinking intently. The lighting is warm, highlighting the contours of his face against a brown background.

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.
On another topic et? read the post, its about explicit learning xD EDIT its implicit my bad !
off topic, how do you dm people on discourse?
So, are we using this thread, or should we make a Google space or something?
I created a discord Discord Join the ACING ROE 1 Discord Server! Check out the ACING ROE 1 community on Discord – hang out with 1 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat. @all
The image shows the Discord logo. It features a white, stylized game controller-like shape with eyes and a smile, set against a solid periwinkle blue circular background. This simple and recognizable design is the symbol for the popular communication platform, Discord.
