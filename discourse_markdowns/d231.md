I didn’t get any error for Astana. The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that. image 1860×703 133 KB
The image shows a Jupyter Notebook named "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb" displaying weather data. The code snippet `df.to_json(orient='records')` converts a DataFrame to JSON format with 'records' orientation. The output is a JSON list of records, each representing weather information for a specific date, including high and low temperatures and a weather summary.
It worked for me; only 4–5 values caused errors, which I fixed manually. Additionally, I corrected the console code, which now provides the correct result.
what is this magic trick… please elaborate … Error: At [10].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt16027074". Actual: "tt8008948" i dont see that value in data …
You can manually edit that. I also have to manually edit one entry to get the correct answer.
Hi, As mentioned in the question, you have to sort by “joined” so it should be “ https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers: >120&sort=joined&order=desc”
There are two “Vienna”. The question4 is referring to which one?
Manually make correction in your answer as provided in the error message. If no such words are available insert those and check
check if the action is commited
try copying the expected result and pasting it inside the quotations
Check the log of the daily commit .
Ahh, I have the same doubt too!
For the links, this format worked for me: [ < link text > ] (#)
Yes I got it now. Thank you!
it should be “2.9” instead of 2.9
looks like formatting or the passed conditions have some issue… can you check and verify it once and see?
Error: At [3].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag”. Actual: “4. The Next 365 Days” {“id”: “tt21106646”, “title”: “4. The Next 365 Days”, “rating”: “2.9”, “year”: “2022”} my result , there is no any entry with “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag” on IMDB
I am getting missing links as error in the 10th question. How to do it?
Mine is giving 1/10 on running without even writing anything? This is happening for Q3? Is it just a glitch?
Yes happened to me too, refresh the page, mine got fixed!
Check you pdf you can find a word with blue colour and underline. Give some dummy link and use link mark with the word
