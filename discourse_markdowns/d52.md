Totally Agree with @23f2004837 Best course so far from learning POV.
Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. " That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team

Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

true but I wish they can inform how quickly they can evaluate for those using paid platforms / ngrok
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Hello Carlton, When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2? I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly.
@carlton @Saransh_Saini same issue I only have $80 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week.
@parthivn28 @Harshjayswal-2003 @23f2004912 Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow. Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up. Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation. Kind regards

Yess, I too did the same , previously submitted on 11.55 and edited my response on 12.01 with /api . Hope u will consider it . @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
hello can you share ip address whenever you hit our api then we know you hitting it please
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety. Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration. Thanks & Regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand yes same issue
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Sirs, I too am facing this issue..
21f2000588: check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query I couldn’t get what this part means?
The image features a white letter "D" on a blurred, solid fuchsia background. The letter has a slight soft glow or blur around its edges, creating a subtle emphasis against the vibrant backdrop. It's a simple yet bold graphic.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine. {
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
} Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly. image 1775×721 21.8 KB Correct output image – image 1806×235 10.1 KB Hope you get my point which i’m trying to convey sir.
The interface shows a "multipart/form-data" request with required fields. The "question" field asks to "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single." A file "q-multi-cursor.json.txt" is chosen for the "file" field. There are buttons to "Execute" or "Clear" the form, as well as "Cancel" and "Reset" options.
The image shows a successful server response with code 200. The response body contains a JSON object with one key: "answer", whose value appears to be a long string consisting of hexadecimal characters. A download button is available for the response body.
@23f2004912 Just a brother trying to help students gain valuable skills. Nothing more brother. The success of students’ future, is the best reward. Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you’ve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not. Kindest regards, Just Carlton (nothing more).
The way we test your api is not through a front end. We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions. We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like. As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine. Kind regards
sir @carlton currently iam facing an issue sir.  just now in order check weather my api is working fine or not . i  just tried curl some question but unexpectedly i got timeout error from vercel. i have deployed my app in vercel only. when i checked out i found that in vercel for free account the request timeout is 10s. what to do sir some times gpt take more time to respond. The same endpoint after an hour i tried works fine . will this be an issue sir .
@carlton i also edited my form due to /api/ after deadline on monday can u tell atleast whats the status on this query
Dear @Carlton and @S.Anand , I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash. Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.
