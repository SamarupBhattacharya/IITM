We are not considering Dockerfile’s with wrong name(anything other than Dockerfile), and wrong location(anything other than root) in github repo.
Will I still get a zero?

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files Dear @Carlton sir I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place. My GitHub repository was public at the time of submission. I had included the Dockerfile as required. I also added the MIT License to the project. For your reference, I am also attaching a snapshot of the repository as it was during the submission time. Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a concrete reason for giving zero marks . I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence . emailsnapshotfor_discourse 1785×957 130 KB repo_snapshotforDiscourse 1842×968 84.4 KB please just check my repo  manually  and clarify whether it was public or not . What is going on this degree .

Hi sir I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark. During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change. Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir Thank you
Dear @carlton Sir, I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks. image 452×132 6.53 KB

same i also got 8 marks but today in mail i got 0 marks
Same issue for me, I was getting 10/20 earlier and now, in mail it shows 1.
Same issue for me, i had got 4/20 before but in the mail, my marks is given as 0. Please help
Respected sir, I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.
Dear @carlton Sir, I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark. I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard. Thank you.
Respected Sir, I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with. According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number. Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team. Thank you for your time and assistance!
@carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.
I am facing the exact same issue

@carlton sir  When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code. Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now. image 1897×965 112 KB WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 17.28.47_927a687b 1600×1200 181 KB
