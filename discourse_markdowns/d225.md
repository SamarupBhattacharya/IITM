The image displays a "Grinning Face with Sweat" emoji. It features a yellow face with a wide, open smile showcasing upper teeth and a pink tongue.  A single, prominent blue droplet of sweat is positioned on the upper right side of the face, indicating nervousness, relief, or slight discomfort despite the positive expression.

sir in the weather question could you provide from where do we get the bbc api because i have searched a lot and havent been able to find it
https://tds.s-anand.net/#/bbc-weather-api-with-python
try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script output. Or else try refreshing the browser and check.
@carlton Previously i got correct on q2 but now i am getting the error when i refresh the page “TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading ‘textContent’)”
Please try city=“Mumbai” as a string literal.
Q4 BBC Weather I don’t understand why I am getting Error: At root: Different number of properties Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates? @carlton Please guide. Thank you. BBC weather 565×781 30.5 KB
The image shows a task to develop a system using the BBC Weather API, extract data, and transform it into a JSON format where the date corresponds to a weather description. The example output illustrates the desired format. The task asks for the JSON weather description for Osaka, but the provided JSON is flagged with an error indicating a different number of properties.

Hi Mishkat Please refer to this post. GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science @JoelJeffrey We will be changing this question. Even we found it pretty hard Kind regards Kind regards
The image shows a man with brown hair and fair skin wearing rectangular glasses and a dark purple shirt. He is looking at the camera with a slight smile. The background is a plain, warm yellow-beige color. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting his features.
The image is a yellow smiley face emoji with a wide-open mouth showing its teeth and pink tongue, and closed, smiling eyes. A single drop of sweat is depicted on the right side of the forehead. It expresses relief, embarrassment, or awkwardness in a lighthearted or humorous way.

@s.anand Sir the question 10 of the Graded Assignment 4 is very tough I have tried everything from custom python codes using different libraries to online converted and also formatted using prettier. Please sir guide me how to do the question.
Yep figured that, and after matching the data solved the error and got that question correct. Though thank you.
@s.anand Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is something else ?
Yes we’ll were facing this issue. @carlton sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the question. "We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard Kind regards" So need to worry about that question for now.
The image shows a yellow smiley face emoji. It has a wide-open smile displaying teeth and a slightly reddish tongue. Two curved lines represent the eyes. A single, blue bead of sweat is visible above the right side of the face, conveying nervousness, relief, or awkwardness.

OK, that is good to hear, you won’t believe that yesterday I was trying this question for 2 hours literally, it can be more also.
I was stuck at that question for 2 days, I tried multiple ways but was not able to format the content with prettier as expected, every time I was getting the error “Incorrect. Try again.”
On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now. (FYI, one person did solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)
Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables… But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors? @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
same issue with me as well
