The image displays a JSON data snippet, ostensibly related to a film titled "9. Flight Risk," with an ID of "tt10078772" and a year of "2025".  However, an error message indicates a mismatch in the "year" value, with an expected format of "2025-" but an actual value of "2025-". It looks like there is a problem with the comparison.
Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method. Please refer the instruction. 1000095240 1080×183 43.8 KB
The text indicates that IMDb search results may vary by region and change periodically. It advises manually translating titles and re-running scraper code. A button labeled "Check" is present, potentially to initiate a relevant action related to the search or scraping process.
you can manually add space after the hyphen
I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error
Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float ( 2.9 ) and not a string ( "2.9" ) in your code.
That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method. But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.
Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right https://tds.s-anand.net/#/bbc-weather-api-with-python

I am getting this error again and again after running the code in collab this city Nur-Sultan ? image 936×343 26 KB
The image shows a Python `NameError` traceback. The code attempts to construct a BBC Weather URL using an f-string, but the variable `location_id` is not defined. This is likely because either the `location_id` was not initialized, or there was an error when attempting to find the location ID for Nur-Sultan.

In the second question are we supposed to edit the JSON manually until we reach a correct answer ? I think the expected result has some difference from what shows up in the website
Not able to get the missing links in Q10 Any suggestions welcome please
For question 10 I’ve tried everything. Links and headings work fine, but I’m not able to fix the “missing tables” issue (I’ve also tried using pdfplumber and tabulate). In the pdf as well, I don’t see any tables, any hints or suggestions would be very helpful. Thanks!
there is no location id mentioned as it is mentioned of the different city. please check the city for which you need to find the location id and then proceed
I’m getting the same error in Q4: image 1631×641 34.2 KB
The image shows a task asking for a JSON weather forecast for Los Angeles. The expected output is a JSON object with dates as keys and weather descriptions as values. The user's input has an error "Property name mismatch", with consistent 'Sunny and light winds' forecast from 25-02-16 to 25-02-21. The expected output and user provided input have date discrepancies.
How to actually do the HNRSS one…i can’t find much.
How did u do the links? I’m unable to do links
Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct. This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.
Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days) Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference. Code: import requests

url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
response = requests.get(url)
json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
  weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description
  print("Iteration No. " + str(i))
  print(issue_date)
  print(weather_description)
  
print("Final Weather Data json below")
print(weather_data) Output The number of days data is 14

same with me. In the project it is written that the form should be submitted but there’s no question in the portal.
I have got the same error as well, verified there are workflows run in my repo/actions/runs When I checked the reasons, it could be due to API limit exceeded in a hour, but tried even after some time but no workflows found. image 1345×424 23.7 KB
The image shows a dashboard for "All workflows" on GitHub Actions. It displays two successful workflow runs named "Action runs everyday" on the "main" branch.  One run was scheduled and the other was manually triggered by "Rajalakshmi12". A prompt encourages users to provide feedback to improve GitHub Actions.
