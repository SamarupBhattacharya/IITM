Respected @carlton I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine . To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect. Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question. Thankyou
@carlton Respected sir, I have tried the 5 th question n no. of times but getting error as incorrect answer can i get any guidance on this please. Thankyou
@jivraj , @carlton , @s.anand q5 give same answer which i am getting is incorrect. but i tried manually, python and openrefine, excel everything gives the same answer. please look into it.
We have noted this issue and are looking into it.
In Question 8 I am getting this error Please tell me how do i tackle this errror Error: At root: Array length mismatch
thanku sir also q6 i got 52747 after cleaning the json and trying to extract using all methods 96 lines where reconstructed. but portal keep saying wrong for evry answer.pls check on this also
Q5 I tried with openfire and python script , both are giving me same answer but its not accepted please check . Also in task the ask is to identify " Top-Performing City: Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number." but on top of input box question is different “How many units of Table were sold in Mexico City on transactions with at least 159 units?”
i think there is some bug in Q 1… it shows correct if in percentage I pass comma instead of decimal. kindly check. secondly by multiple logics i checked q 5 & Q 6… but it shows incorrect only. Kindly help
can we get more specified error in q9? it just says, words are too different.
This message is for everyone struggling with Q5 Due to a backend error, the script was incorrectly evaluating your answers. That problem has been fixed and you must check once again. If you are still getting it incorrect, better watch Open Refine - Live Session
