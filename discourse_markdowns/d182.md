We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update. Bottom line: wait till Tuesday Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then. If not let us know Kind regards.
I am experiencing the same issue

The image is a course summary for "Tools in Data Science," labeled as a "New Course." It shows grades for weekly assignments, all scoring 100.00. "Programming Quiz 1" is marked as "Absent." A button invites the user to "Go to Course page."
Dear Sir, I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE  multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent. I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue image 447×486 22.3 KB
The image shows a "Tools in Data Science" course page, marked as "NEW COURSE." Assignment grades for Weeks 1-5 are displayed, with Week 2 showing 65.00 and Week 4 showing 110.00. The first programming quiz indicates the student was absent. A button links to the full course page.

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard. Please clarify. image 930×584 42.8 KB
The image shows a student's current courses, with a CGPA of 7.8. They are taking "Business Data Management" as a repeated course and "Tools in Data Science" as a new course. Assignment scores and quiz status are listed for each course, along with a link to the course page.

Scores have not yet been pushed for everyone. You have to wait till operations push it (most likely Tuesday). Kind regards
