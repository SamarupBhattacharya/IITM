Could you send me your email id. thanks.
Hi, the same issue persists for me for GA 2 and 4. I also did not attemp GA 3. Please look into this. My email id: 24ds3000061@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
My Graded assignment results are also not appearing in the dashboard. My email id is 22f2001532@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
@24ds3000061 @22f2001532 Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed. GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city. Kind regards
Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard. Thanks REVI
