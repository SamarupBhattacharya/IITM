I have solved the question and when i enter the answer its showing me incorrect, sir could you please help me out. I am attaching the images of my code and the tds image 847×696 34.5 KB
The image shows a Python code snippet in a Google Colab notebook, intended for image processing using libraries like NumPy, PIL, and colorsys. The code aims to calculate and print the number of pixels in an image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219 after converting RGB to HLS and normalizing the color values. An incorrect answer of "248985" was provided.

The Python code imports libraries, uploads an image, and converts its RGB values to lightness.  It then counts the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than or equal to 0.219.  The image "lenna.webp" is uploaded, and the code outputs that there are 248985 pixels with lightness greater than 0.219.
this is my code image 857×448 25.8 KB
The Python code analyzes an uploaded image ("lenna.webp") to count pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219. It uses libraries like NumPy, PIL, and colorsys. The code converts the image to RGB, calculates lightness for each pixel, and sums the pixels meeting the criteria.  The final output indicates 248985 pixels have a lightness greater than 0.219.
could you also give me a hint
I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser. In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)
I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp. Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!
image 837×490 26 KB I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work
The Python code uploads and opens an image ("lenna.webp"), converts it to RGB format, calculates the lightness of each pixel using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`, and then counts the number of pixels with lightness greater than 0.219. Finally, the script prints the count of these lighter pixels, which is 248985.
For Graded Assignment 2 Q6, I’m getting the right answer but in portal it throws an error. image 788×221 9.73 KB image 1312×345 16.5 KB This is my vercel deployment https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api
The image displays a web browser window showing a JSON response from a Vercel app deployment. The API endpoint is `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"`. The JSON data indicates a key "marks" with a value of 65. The browser has multiple tabs open, including IIT Madras and Graded Assignments.

The image shows instructions for deploying a Python app to Vercel to expose an API that returns student marks as a JSON response, downloadable via a provided JSON file. CORS should be enabled. A Vercel URL example is shown, but a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error appears.
image 1660×325 47.3 KB image 1792×244 33.8 KB TDS GA2 Q9, I have passed the same class as of the error thrown test case for ease of reference. Both are same to same. Yet I’m getting error when i submit the answer. @carlton @Jivraj , Kindly please clarify what I’m doing wrong. #samesamebutdiffalant
The image shows an attempt to define a FastAPI API endpoint as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, but the response from this endpoint doesn't match the expected data format.  The system will then test this endpoint with a `?class=` query parameter to validate data matching.
The image shows a JSON array displayed in a browser, accessed via the URL "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W".  Each object in the array represents a student, containing a "studentId" and their "class".  The data includes students from classes "5N", "1T", "11P", and "9W".
check expected output, look closely each character within 20-30 characters you might get it
Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek , I don’t see any difference between them. Can you share screen shot of browser console tab and Network tab. Also join tomorrow’s session towards ending of each session we use to take doubts.
@23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL , This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it. image 1822×874 43.7 KB Solution : Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that. image 1709×787 66.9 KB If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts. Kind regards Jivraj
The image shows a "Team Access Required" screen on Vercel. The user, signed in as "jivraj-18," is not authorized to access the deployment URL because they aren't a team member. They can request access to the up-to-date deployment URL or log in with a different Vercel account.
The image shows a Vercel deployment dashboard. The "Production Deployment" page displays a "Not Found" error, indicating the requested URL doesn't exist. However, the deployment details show the project is ready, deployed on January 28th by jivraj-18, with the domain 'api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app'. The options to view code or execute "vercel deploy" are available.
daksh76: I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work Hi @daksh76 , Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.
The image features a capital letter "D" in white or light gray with a subtle shadow or glow effect, set against a dark teal or green background. The letter appears to be centered and the lighting gives it a slight three-dimensional quality.

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 127.0.0.1 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works. If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address. We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.
image 1903×657 83.4 KB image 1914×751 82.1 KB @Jivraj , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to. Sure, I will join tonight’s session and try to rectify the issue. Meanwhile will update here if i was able to resolve it.
The image shows a web browser's developer tools, specifically the Network tab, displaying the response from an API endpoint. The request URL includes parameters for "class" with values "5N", "1T", "11P", and "9W". The response is a JSON array of objects, each containing a "studentId" and "class" property, indicating student IDs and their respective classes. The HTTP status code is 200, indicating success.

image 1559×334 19.5 KB This url shows correct but after few hour it shows this error @carlton pls help me to fix this
The image shows instructions for using Llamafile, including downloading the model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. It displays a sample ngrok URL and an actual one. An error message indicates the response is too old, including JSON data regarding choices, content, domain, model, tokens, and completion details, suggesting an issue with the Llamafile server.
you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.
sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on the portal
if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to understand where i might be making a mistake
