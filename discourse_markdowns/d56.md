@Saransh_Saini Sir can you please check 24f2000940?
@Saransh_Saini could you please give indication of how long we should keep the server running? Is it ok to shut those down now or will more evaluations be conducted?
You have been evaluated.
Your app crashed during the initial evaluation. But the re-run was successful.
@Jivraj sir could you please check for 24f2003130… Today’s morning there was a glitch in my vercel…but I think since it was after evaluation it shouldn’t have impacted that…could you please verify it once
@Saransh_Saini a gentle reminder.
You have been successfully evaluated

Keep it running for the next hour, have to generate your report/
@Saransh_Saini Hello sir, can you please say when can we expect results to be published? . Also we would like to know still how much time or days should our server be running? Thankyou in advance

@saransh_saini @carlton Can we kindly expect the result for Project 2 today?
No, but we’ll release the first batch soon.
Hello @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Could you please share an update on the expected results for P2? Also, could you confirm whether my evaluation has been completed? Additionally, when would it be safe to stop the VM, as it is consuming a significant amount of credits? Looking forward to your response. Thanks and Regards.
@Saransh_Saini is my evaluated yet? lemme know due to credit on azure need to check them also.
Hello, I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem. Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again. see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook image 1543×875 50.7 KB
The image displays API status and queries. There are 39 total requests from one IP address. Recent queries involve InfoCore Solutions, FastAPI applications, and retrieving ODI batting stats from ESPN Cricinfo using IMDb's advanced search. An alert indicates that the API at app.algsoch.tech is currently down as of April 7, 2025.
Its done @parthivn28
