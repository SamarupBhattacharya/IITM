Have you succeeded in running the shape file for Q10? It seems to have some error. @lakshaygarg654
No, I use google to get MTFCC code for given road segment and  after that mtfcc pdf to classify that road segment.
I  downloaded the complete shape file zip from the census.gov site. Here is the link: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/PRISECROADS/tl_2024_36_prisecroads.zip It works fine in QGIS. @lakshaygarg654
they have not provide all the files needed to read that shp file in the question . but your link includes them. thanks…
I tried to access shapefile from official website 4-5 days ago, but server was under maintenance. I will check again Q10 after quiz 2. Thanks for sharing.
My question 9 for GA6 is : @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444 878×668 38.1 KB Screenshot 2025-03-15 205456 1333×366 45.8 KB I solved it in colab but options are getting mismatched there…kindly clarify this issue..

for the above question the options are None of these are matching and answer is around 11.5 kms 3848 meters 6265 meters 4110 meters 5106 meters
For 7th Question in GA6 I got the answer 14265.93 Meters but the option I have in 7th are 6069 meters 7687 meters 6106 meters 7035 meters @carlton @Jivraj
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini for question 4, i have tried =forecast and also =forecast.ets , both of them are not working. There are two columns for years. One is year of manufacturing, another is year of registration. which one to take. for question 7, none of the options match. I am selecting the MOST ACCURATE among the given options. Hope, it is correct
Can anyone help me out on how to approach and solve the 10th question please!?
Check the distances of other locations from the central location. One student found Question 7 of the GA6 Option Set based on the distances of other points, which do not match the requirements of Question 7.
i have the same issue
yes i have the same issue and i got the same answer and am give the same options @carlton sir what to do?
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini For 7th Question in GA6 I got the answer 14265.9275 Meters but the option I have in 7th are 6069 meters 7687 meters 6106 meters 7035 meters
Hello Sir, Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from @carlton sir we should select the absolute maximum value. image 978×393 23.3 KB Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum. For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows, image 748×431 17.5 KB So shouldn’t it be -0.13?

Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0. image 962×459 29.1 KB In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states. I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the values I got for each question. Please verify. |pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for Karnataka|| -0.026685695 |pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for karnataka|| 0.003953219 |pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for karnataka|| -0.010839295 |pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for maharashta|| 0.029128825 |pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra|| 0.013019585 |pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra|| -0.056866212

@Jivraj @carlton Dear sirs, I have question no 7 got marked as 0. Please check the question below and the haversine distance for the given post comes to around 11.5 kms which is not matccing with any of the options and I have selected the closest answer. please check and let me know. image 935×529 40.1 KB

@carlton @Jivraj I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question) Also, my question 4 was : As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini In Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but it is giving   answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values are quite close. image 1227×446 24 KB
