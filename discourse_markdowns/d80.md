Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir, I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: 1000042547 1080×578 187 KB Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays” To filter such logs, we need: Time → for the hour and the day (Monday) Method → to filter POST URL → to filter /images/ So, the correct minimal set is: Time, Method, URL Time → needed Method → needed URL → needed Referer → not needed, but not harmful So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it. 1000042548 1080×301 71.5 KB Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: Status is numeric (200) Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct All required fields are present and properly formatted The other options were as follows: 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 1000042545 1079×468 35.7 KB Correct Answer(s): PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). Incorrect Answer: POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) Thank you
This is a multiple choice question asking for a valid log entry based on a specified format. Four log entries are provided as options, with one of them deemed correct, indicated by a green checkmark next to it. The correct log entry has the proper structure and valid values. The incorrect answers are in red, with errors.

The image shows a multiple-choice question.  It asks which fields are required to filter POST requests for pages under /images/ between 15:00 and 18:00 on Mondays.  The correct answer, identified by a green checkmark, is "Time, Request, Method, URL."  The other options are marked incorrect with a red asterisk.
This is a multiple-choice question asking which HTTP method is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. The options are POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE, with PUT being indicated as the correct answer. Additional information is provided about the question's sub-section number, ID, and whether question shuffling is allowed.

Agree & second all thoughts shared by @24f2003130 above. I also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries. The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ . image 1108×394 81.9 KB The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct. Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct. Request you to please clarify and consider these points.
The image shows a multiple-choice question. The question asks how to best count 404 error requests for pages under '/error/' after log entries have been filtered into "filtered_entries".  The options provided suggest using `len(filtered_entries)`, `len(entries)`, `sum(1 for entry in entries)`, and "None of these". The correct answer is "None of these."
Yes @carlton the wording of the question made it seem like the filters were already applied on the list filtered_entries .
Clarifications on Queries Which of the following is a valid log entry based on the provided format? Due to a technical issue in the portal, both options 1 and 4 are correct answers. The final scoring has been adjusted accordingly, and full marks will be awarded for either response. HTTP method is idempotent This question has been excluded from scoring as three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE) are idempotent, with only POST being non-idempotent. Entries with 404 status code Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4. Which of the following fields are necessary to filter “POST requests made for pages under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”? Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL) is correct because: Option B includes Size and Status, which aren’t needed for filtering by time, method, and URL Option C includes Referer, which is unnecessary unless filtering by source page Option D includes Status and Server, which aren’t relevant for this specific filtering requirement
Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time → for checking the hour and weekday. Method → to filter only POST. URL → to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.
Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story. While all the other changes have been made with the same reflecting in the score, that question still says “The question and answer remain the same . No changes required”, which is different from your post. image 923×352 72 KB Can you please look into it? Thanks Regards, Shivaditya
The image shows a row of data for item 31, identified by the ID 6406531231230, which is an MCQ. It has a weight of "W" and a score of 0. The IDs 6406534159860 and 6406534159863 are listed, along with a 1.00 rating. It's labelled as "Not Modified" because the question and answer remain the same, needing no changes.
This is a multiple-choice question. The question asks about the best way to count 404 status codes under `/error/` from filtered log entries. The options include using `len()` on the filtered entries, on all entries, using `sum()`, or none of the provided options. The correct answer is "None of these".
@iamprasna sir , the scores have been updated on the dashboard as well and the answer for the question in point 3 is still the same Additionally , sir I have attached the snapshot of a dec’24 TDS PYQ which is a replica of this question and the answer for the same is mention the first option. 1000042796 1080×538 84.7 KB The link for the same has been attached for your referance drive.google.com IIT M FOUNDATION DIPLOMA FN EXAM QDF2 22 Dec 2024.pdf Google Drive file.
The question asks for the best way to count successful GET requests under "/telugump3/" after filtering log entries into `filtered_entries`. The correct answer is to use `len(filtered_entries)` which counts the number of items in the filtered list. Other options are incorrect for counting the filtered entries.
That’s a great find. They’re the same question with just different parameters. Please look into it @iamprasna sir.
@carlton sir and @Jivraj sir please look into this question and clarify this Thank you
Hi, From where are you checking the transcripts? I’m not able to see the answer transcripts in the score checker app. image 1891×622 31.7 KB
The screenshot displays a "Score Checker" interface, possibly from an academic institution.  It shows a table with a student's email (23ds3000185@ds.study.iitm.ac.in), hall ticket (S2DAD23DS3000185), course code (SE2002), and a total score of 70. A note indicates that scores are preliminary and subject to change after official sign-off. There are also links for Transcript, Home, and Logout.
Click on the eye button …then you will be able to view your transcript
Thanks for the reply, but I only see the question id’s and answer id’s, not able to find the transcripts. image 1867×923 94.1 KB
The image shows a "Score Checker" table displaying results for multiple-choice questions. It includes columns like Question ID, Result, Score, Selected Option, Correct Option, and Marks. Question 4 is highlighted, indicating that both option 2 and 3 should be awarded marks for that question; otherwise, the mark scheme of question 9 remains the same.
It seems that the option to download the answer key has been removed. However, you could consider reaching out to someone in the group or checking the dashboard for  solution pdf of question paper. You can then match the questions in order, even if the IDs don’t align exactly—it should still give you a general idea. From there, you can proceed accordingly.
@iamprasna @carlton Please look into it once. According to point 3 of @iamprasna ’s post, I should get full credit for that question and it will take me to a perfect 100 score in ET from the current 97. I brought this into attention before the scores were pushed to the dashboard. Regards, Shivaditya
The correction has been done to the following question for both the FN and AN sessions. You must be able to see the change in scores shortly Entries with 404 status code Although the instructions did not explicitly state that filters applied for status code 404, we acknowledge this ambiguity. Full credit will be awarded for both option 1 and option 4.
Thank you sir for acknowledging our requests and resolving the error
