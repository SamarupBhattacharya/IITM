Sir, I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks. Kindly, update my marks in dashboard. @carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini
Hi @Sakshi6479 , You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark. Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.02.31 am 2566×224 23.2 KB We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction. That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4. Kind regards
IITM BS students can earn a bonus mark on their graded assignment by participating in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread on Discourse.  To qualify, students must post a relevant question or reply within the TDS Jan 2025 thread. This is intended to encourage active discussion among the students.
