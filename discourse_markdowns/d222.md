Error: At [10].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2025– ". Actual: “2025–” Can someone help me with this? Thanks Edit: Resolved
Q8 I got the Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in. the .yml file contains the following " name: Daily Commit on: schedule: - cron: ‘0 12 * * *’ # Runs daily at 12:00 PM UTC workflow_dispatch:  # This allows manual trigger jobs: commit: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Make a dummy change with email 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the commit
  run: |
    echo "This is a daily commit" > daily_commit.txt
    git config --global user.email "23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    git config --global user.name "23f2003853"
    git add daily_commit.txt
    git commit -m "Daily commit from 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    git push" @Jivraj can help me to fix the issue
Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository) Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error
name: Daily Commit on: schedule: - cron: ‘0 0 * * *’  # Runs once a day at midnight UTC workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering of the workflow jobs: commit: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Make daily commit by 23f3000264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
  run: |
    echo "Daily commit by 23f3000264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" >> daily_commit.txt
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "Daily commit"
    git push

The image shows an error message after a user entered a GitHub repository URL. The system prompts the user to input their repository URL, providing a format example. The user enters "https://github.com/dakshagarwal76/daily-update", but the system returns an error stating that "No executed job step matches 23f3000264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

For Q10, I am extracting the text first using PyMuPDF (fitz) and then using markdownify to convert it to markdown and finally prettier. However despite trying changing it from PyMuPDF to other text extraction libraries, I end up getting Incorrect. Try Again errors
I think you have used the wrong document, because, this is the marks list for Q9
which tool you are using ?
HOW TO GET BBC API KEY image 1888×868 75.5 KB
The task involves using the BBC Weather API to retrieve and transform weather forecasts for Tel Aviv. It requires fetching the location ID, extracting the "issueDate" and "enhancedWeatherDescription", and creating a JSON object mapping each date to its corresponding weather description. The response box has an error: "SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input".

in the bbc question what should be starting and the ending date
you dont need the key you need that file used in 2 lecture videos just look for it.
The image is a yellow thumbs-up emoji. It shows a hand with the thumb extended upward, symbolizing approval, agreement, or positivity. The background is black, which makes the yellow color of the emoji stand out prominently.

Please find below the screen shot showing the committed with step name my iitm email id image 1366×768 79.8 KB But the answer says image 602×164 21 KB Please help to fix the issue
The image shows a GitHub workflow file configuration for a project named "23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The workflow includes a "daily-commit" job scheduled to run daily at 10:00 AM UTC. It uses the "actions/checkout@v3" action, with persistence of credentials set to false, and runs on an Ubuntu latest environment. It also allows for manual triggering.

The image shows a validation step for a GitHub workflow. It instructs users to place their workflow in the `.github/workflows` directory, trigger the workflow, and verify it appears as the most recent action, creating a commit within 5 minutes. An entered repository URL `https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows` results in an error, stating that no executed job step matches a specific email address.
Still the issue is there. Have posted screen shot.
what Mr. Sakthivel S said is correct. could you tell me what tool did you use to convert .md file. I have done as per links in question and used chatgpt also. but nothing is correct
Please give the solution if you got any…have you been able to solve the bbc weather question?
@s.anand @carlton In question 8 i got error “Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO ): https://github.com/Ansh205/github-actions Error: No workflow runs found” But i have successfully commited Screenshot 2025-02-05 193233 1462×642 38.4 KB
The image shows a list of 4 workflow runs titled "Daily Commit Workflow." The first run, "#4," succeeded and was manually run by Ansh205 five minutes ago. The previous three runs, #1, #2, and #3, all failed and were also manually run by Ansh205. They are 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 37 minutes old respectively. All runs are on the "main" branch.
