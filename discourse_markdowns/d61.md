Sir Please don’t ignore this —this is my last term and if I fail, I will have to restart the entire diploma. I kindly request you to reconsider my project evaluation. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand @Saransh_Saini
MY Project 2  status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum. Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here: API Form Submission I kindly request you to review my submission image 1905×953 32.7 KB
The image depicts a single link from a chain, rendered in a light blue or gray color with a subtle glossy effect. The link is oval-shaped and interlocking, suggesting connection or linkage. The background is solid black, emphasizing the isolated chain link.

The image shows a "Submit Your Question" form on a website. It has a text area for the question and an optional file upload (ZIP format). A blue "Submit" button is at the bottom. The website is hosted on Vercel, as indicated by the URL.
Project 2 marks are showing 0 for me, when I checked logs no requests were made to my endpoint. Could you please check into this, and update as soon as possible? Getting marks in this project would help me to pass this sub. Also, please check if evaluation has been done for my endpoint or not. Thank you
2 to 3 days can be given to fix issues please, help us students complete this subject successfully Please consider this sir
The image shows a yellow smiley face emoji with a small, bright blue tear dropping from its left eye. The emoji has a simple, closed smile and two dark brown eyes. It conveys a mixed emotion, potentially suggesting relief, bittersweetness, or attempting to mask sadness with a smile.

Sir, I too had provided render API and my logs do not show that it was accessed during the evaluation period. I had submitted the link in the form which was provided to update the link as i had not received any mail that my project had been evaluated before that. Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now. Sir, can you please look into this. Thank you

The image displays a single, pixelated link from a chain. The link is colored in shades of light blue or gray and appears to be made of metal or a similar material. It's against a stark black background, emphasizing the single link as the focal point.
Request for Re-evaluation I have completed the entire project and ensured that my model is working correctly. Despite this, I have received zero marks , which seems to be an error. API LINK: https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission. Please verify the working model and the completion of all project requirements. Thank you. @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj

Dear Sir, In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints ( http://35.192.157.22.80 ) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding  /api/ and it was http://35.192.157.22/api/ . My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.
Sir I have also recieved 0 marks, but I checked now also using python requests library and my server is working fine .  But I see a lot of GET requets instead of POST in my logs file which was for the past couple of days requests, which is very unlikely . Please check my link again , its still active . App link  - http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2 My test file- image 1331×627 52.2 KB My server log file - Screenshot 2025-04-14 144745 934×490 31.1 KB My app request handeling - please  kindly look into the matter sir @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj
The Python script sends a POST request to a FastAPI endpoint with a question about total "Gold" ticket sales and a CSV file. The server responds with status code 200 and a JSON containing an SQL query to calculate the total sales from the 'tickets' table where the ticket type is "Gold".
The image displays a log of HTTP requests. Most "INFO" entries show "GET" requests returning a "404 Not Found" error. One "POST" request to "/tdsp2" returned a "200 OK" status.  Numerous "WARNING" messages indicate "Invalid HTTP request received," signaling potential issues with the client requests.
This image shows a Python code snippet defining an asynchronous function named `tdsp2`. This function is decorated with `@app.post("/tdsp2")`, indicating it handles POST requests to the "/tdsp2" endpoint. It accepts two parameters: a string `question` obtained from a form and an optional `file` of type `UploadFile`, which defaults to `None`.
I noticed that my  Project 2  status is currently marked as  “Absent” in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I **submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline via the designated forum. Additionally, my Vercel server is still active , and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here: API Form Submission I also have a response copy from the forum confirming my submission , including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status. image 1503×644 37.4 KB image 1905×953 32.7 KB
The image depicts a simple, light-blue chain link against a black background. The link is a stylized, rounded rectangle shape, interlocked with another similar shape. The depiction suggests connection, a linked system, or perhaps a hyperlink icon. The design is clean and minimalistic.

The image shows a portion of a Google Form. It asks for the link to a GitHub repository containing code for "Project 2" and provides an example URL format. It also requests the link to an API endpoint, specifying that a POST request should be possible. Links have been input to answer the questions.
The image displays a web form titled "Submit Your Question". It features a text box for entering a question and an optional file upload for a ZIP file. A blue "Submit" button is located at the bottom of the form. The URL in the browser is "tdsproject2.vercelapp/api/".
I Got 0 in Project 2 but my server was perfectly working and giving accurate responses .
