My doesn’t show  the grades yet. Are they released?
I guess grades aren’t yet released for TDS. My dashboard too not showing grades for TDS & BA. For MLP though I can see my grade.
They are not released yet. We are still checking all discrepancies that have been submitted via our discrepancies submission portal.
