I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to .up.railway.app . I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains? @Jivraj @carlton
Error code: 401 - {‘error’: {‘message’: ‘Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.’, ‘type’: ‘invalid_request_error’, ‘param’: None, ‘code’: ‘invalid_issuer’}} This error is persisting despite many attempts.
you have given diffrent variable name in environment and in app
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Can you pls confirm on timeline since azure take money so till when do we have to turn on our deployment portal services
Also if we are using ngrok , how long do we have to keep it running
Yup, this is correct. All we need is the JSON object.
We’ll try to keep this in consideration while developing the evaluation script. But to be on the safer side keep sending requests to your server on such intervals that it doesn’t go inactive.
@Saransh_Saini @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Please extend the deadline for TDS Project 2. The MAD 1 project and two OPPEs have taken up all my time. I have completed my TDS project up to the Week 3 assignment solutions, and only two weeks remain to complete Weeks 4 and 5.

We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed.
I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I’ve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays
I think it should be given many had their OPPE also
Sir, please reply. Otherwise, all my hard work up to Week 3 assignment will go to waste.
Even Im getting the same error. Did you find a resolution for this?
are you sure api requests are going through the IITM AI Proxy and not OpenAI directly?
I am facing this issue can any one help image 717×572 25.9 KB
The image shows an error message indicating that a serverless function hosted on Vercel has crashed, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error. The error code is "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" with a specific ID. While the connection and Vercel itself are working, the function failed to execute.  The message advises visitors to contact the website owner, and the owner to check logs and learn how to fix the error.

Please check the logs.
Hi @s.anand and @carlton Sir, It would be really  great if the deadline for submission could be extended by one more day. While we understand your reasons, we kindly request you to consider our situation as well.

Questions that have access hidden divs, how would the parameters be provided ? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton
Sometimes the server shuts down, what would happen then? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
