Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url …Kindly clarify regarding this.
image 1010×145 13.6 KB Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ??
The application exposes an API endpoint at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. This endpoint requires a POST request with the question, and it can also handle optional file attachments using the multipart/form-data format.
@Saransh_Saini please look into my matter and please clear my doubt
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I received this mail from TDS Google Group Announcement this morning at 10:30 am. The Project 2 submission date mentioned in the mail i.e. 15 March 2025 contradicts with submission date mentioned in Tools in Data Science and Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread i.e. 31 March 2025. Please clarify. image 788×973 265 KB image 1069×531 41.8 KB image 1115×601 66.5 KB
This email from IITM BS Team outlines the eligibility criteria and grading structure for the "Tools in Data Science" course.  To attend the final exam, students need an average of >=40/100 from their best two weekly assessments. The course grade is determined by GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, and the final exam (F), with varying weightages. Key dates for assessments are listed.
Project 2, titled "TDS Solver," is due March 31, 2025, with results announced April 15. Students in IIT Madras' Data Science program are tasked with building an LLM-based application to automatically answer graded questions for the "Tools in Data Science" course. A discussion thread is provided for questions.
The image depicts a discussion thread for Project 2 - TDS Solver within a "Tools in Data Science" course.  S.Anand, a course faculty member, prompts students to post questions about the project. The deadline is set for March 31, 2025. The thread has 530 views, 32 likes, 3 links, and 24 users, and was pinned on March 3.
The deadline is 31st March for Project 2. Please ignore the announcement email. We apologise for the confusion. Kind regards
Is there any proxy_Ai token as provided earlier for the project 1..
Hi Ayush, Just go the AI Proxy token issue page and re-issue it or use the same one. The limits get reset. Kind regards
My Approach , is to scrape and parse all the current question create embeddings ,  of the questions. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1 Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy to deploy a server and return an url
Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..) Thanks! Does anyone willing to work with me..? contact: whatsapp(8697454203)
Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.
Did you just Post your number on a public forum?
They(instructors) only don’t what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that. Flattery gets me everywhere (not really, I really think Anand Sir is OP. Check out his YT )! @s.anand
The image shows a stylized flame emoji. The flame has a gradient of colors, ranging from a bright yellow in the center to orange and then red towards the outer edges and tips. It's a simple, cartoon-like representation of fire.

The image shows a yellow emoji face with brown eyes and a simple, closed mouth smile. The emoji has a hand raised to its forehead in a gesture resembling a facepalm or a salute. The overall impression is one of frustration, embarrassment, or perhaps a sarcastic greeting.

A good video, with working code for OpenAI agents api .. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z7u6DTDZ8o
should we make the functions on the basis of the GAs or should we make it general so it will be able to perform the task but the data provided will be different. @s.anand @carlton
The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks. So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request) Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer. Give the answer back as specified. Kind regards
carlton: You do not need to do the task as the GA required. Does this mean this type of question won’t be paramaterized? Like instead of code -s there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all? The same confusion is for these type of questions as well: Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.43.34 PM 1329×750 44.4 KB A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance. @carlton @s.anand
The image shows a man with short dark hair, wearing glasses and a purple shirt. He appears to be smiling slightly. The background is a plain, warm beige color, suggesting an indoor setting with soft lighting. It's a headshot or portrait-style image.

The image instructs the user to install and run Visual Studio Code, then execute the command `code -s` in their terminal/command prompt. The user is then asked what the output of the `code -s` command is. The user is also asked to copy and paste the entire output below.

The image displays two questions that require the user to input the result of formulas.  The first uses Google Sheets with functions like `SUM`, `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`, and `SEQUENCE`. The second question involves an Excel formula that uses `SUM`, `TAKE`, and `SORTBY`, noting that it will only work in Office 365. The user is prompted to enter the output of each formula.
21f2000709: Like instead of code -s there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all? there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required. The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.
Here is a summary of the image:

The image shows a man with short, dark hair and a light complexion. He is wearing a checkered shirt. He has a serious expression on his face. The background is blurred, with hints of greenery.

Guys, I have designed a new version of this project. Please ask questions related to the graded assignment and let me know if you observe any errors. AI Question Answering
Means no github, image related, vs-code, vercel, etc. will be there
And the answer will be in string format ??
