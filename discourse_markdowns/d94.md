swati-iitm/project1_final This is your github repo which doesn’t have a Dockerfile. That’s why It didn’t pass Prechecks
We have reevaluated it, we have scores avaliable for your submission.
Sir I understand you will be busy evaluating all the files and reevaluating them as well. I just wanted to know if its a confirm 0 for those who got evaluation log file MISSING and didnt get the other mail that many got in the past 2 days… Just to confirm… cause i think am getting 0 from that @carlton @Jivraj
So can anything be done about it now as it seems to pass more tasks without the proxy requirement? It is fine if not.
Please, can you put a screenshot of where it has been communicated, prior to the deadline.
We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image. Kind regards, TDS team
@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission. Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618 1335×667 57.9 KB
The email "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores" informs a learner about prerequisite checks for Project 1. It lists five requirements, including GitHub repository accessibility, a MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and Docker image accessibility. The project failed, Docker image presence is the only one to pass. The github repository, the Dockerfile and the MIT license were not.
IMG_7078 828×1049 164 KB Same for me sir, i had everything correct still its showing:- Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL I have submitted everything correctly . Please carefully look into this and recheck the project submitted.
This image shows the evaluation results for Project 1 prerequisites. While the GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license passed, the Docker image was not present and public in Dockerhub. Consequently, the project prerequisites failed, resulting in a score of 0 and a warning about submission evaluation failure.

The image shows the results of a Project 1 prerequisite evaluation.  While the GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license passed, the Docker image failed to be found and public in Dockerhub. Due to this failure, the overall prerequisites and Project 1 score is 0.

The email from "TDS Team" notifies a learner of their Project 1 score (0). The email outlines the project's prerequisites, including a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a MIT license and valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The email indicates that the learner's submission failed all prerequisite checks, resulting in the project not being evaluated.
@carlton sir, similar thing happened to me as well, I had got the mail that git repo, dockerfile and lisence is not present or accessible while all the prerequisites are completed from my end. Can you please reevaluate my submission. 1000051556 1238×2131 182 KB
This email details an evaluation for TDS Project 1, outlining requirements for GitHub repository and Docker image accessibility. The Docker image passed the evaluation, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license presence failed. As a result, the project prerequisites failed, and the project score is 0.
Hi Prashant, Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation. Kind regards
Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others. if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

The email from TDS IITM, sent on Feb 16, warns learners that their Project 1 submissions are at risk of scoring zero marks if they fail basic sanity checks. Only 284 out of 530+ submissions passed, with 250+ learners receiving error emails to check their Github repo, MIT license, Dockerfile, and Docker image accessibility.
I agree with you. It should have been explicitly mentioned in the project page (even if we have mentioned it in live sessions)
@carlton @Jivraj Put some light on this poor soul’s message also ;')
my repo has both the dockerfile with correct name (Dockerfile and in the root folder), license and is public. Please look into this . @carlton sir . @Jivraj GitHub - veershah1231/tds_proj_1: Tds project and i have made them 2 months ago and is not a new commit. 1000105386 1072×1787 256 KB why is it saying i got 0? please look into it.
This email details Project 1 prerequisites: a public GitHub repository with a MIT license, a Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The learner's current evaluation shows the Docker image is passing, but the GitHub repository's presence, Dockerfile, and MIT license in the repo are failing, resulting in a failing grade.
@carlton @jivraj Sir I received a mail like everyone that my git-hub repository is not public and not MIT licensed. I even filled the g-form correctly while submitting. But I had fulfilled the above required criteria. Please look into this matter ASAP. Here is my git repo link : [ GitHub - 23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project ]. ( https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_ Screenshot (390) 1920×1080 266 KB Screenshot (391) 1920×1080 208 KB aa_tds_project). I have attached screenshots for your reference. Thank you
The email shows a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluation. The student failed to meet all requirements except for the Docker image being public. The GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not present in the correct location. Consequently, the student's prerequisite check failed, and their Project 1 score is 0.
The image shows a GitHub repository named "llm_aa_tds_project" owned by user "23f1001415". It lists project files like `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `README.md`, with commit messages indicating initial commits including Dockerfile and application code. The repository has one watcher, zero stars, and primarily uses Python (98.4%) with Dockerfile (1.6%).

@Jivraj I too had the same issue (image was run on wrong architecture) and filled the gform that was circulated. When should we expect to get our scores? Thanks Pradeep Mondal
Hi @21f2000709 We have used another approach because of architecture problem, by pulling through latest commit from github before 18th feb. Just checked we have results for you.
Hi @23f1001415 This was a problem from our side and we rechecked and now we score against your submission.
