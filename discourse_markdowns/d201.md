Hi @23f2005138 , We didn’t validate locations on Nominathim, so there might be some problems. kind regards
The way the instructor extracted the data was not clear in the live session. Please release code or explain properly please. @Jivraj @carlton
Hi @23f1002382 Solutions for ROE will be released soon. Kind regrads
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Is the Mock ROE link out, if it is please merge into that, i could not find it. If it is not yet updated, please do and also merge with relevant post please, Cheers
Is the link out? … For Feb 26th? 8 pm?
no communication regarding ROE-2?
https://22f3001919.github.io/tds_project_1_may_24/ also this link is down? dataset for ROE 1?
do we have mock ROE 2 today @carlton ? Kindly confirm the timings!
Did you all not solve the ROE already?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40). !unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder import os

Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files: students.csv has 2 columns: studentId: A unique identifier for each student class: The class (including section) of the student subjects.csv has 2 columns: studentId: The identifier for each student subject: The name of the subject they have chosen What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order. !unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/students.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv")
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="studentId")

Hi @23f1002382 That’s a private repo, so won’t be accessible now. use Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1 , It have same dataset in some other format. Kind regards
@23f1002382 Good to see students are collaborating for Solving questions, this is exactly what helps a lot in real ROE.
@all Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between Doha and Muscat . World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the Haversine distance . What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled? Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas. HTML2= """"

Actually you dont have to soup this question. Just copy paste in excel
45 min up? Not even half WEW
The image shows that a quiz or test ended on Sunday, November 17, 2024, at 2:00 pm IST. The score achieved was 6 out of a possible 12.  Buttons are displayed for "Check all" and "Save", likely for reviewing results or saving the score.

how? like extract data with excel with link and table number?
No just copy and paste from webpage to google sheets or excel and then save as csv
Yeah it works THANK YOU
Just to confirm, we are allowed to collaborate our code with our peers?
