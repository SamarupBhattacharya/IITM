thats confidential, im not an idiot xD, that will get me definitely  in trouble
no, not really . Just your app

Blunder in your main.py . You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY_TOKEN. Btw what you using for phase B?
yes i will change that
nothing i think, i’ll import those generic functions and use tool usage only probably if can’t crack dynamic code generation
i don’t have that github.com TDS-Project-1/tds-project-1/app at main · ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project-1 Contribute to ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project-1 development by creating an account on GitHub.
Image URL 'https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg' has an unsupported MIME type ('image/svg+xml'). Skipping explanation.
What we expect in project. server running inside docker container at 8000. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory. Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference) try to debug it with help of chatgpt. You can also use codespaces for trying another network. Streamlining setup with GitHub Codespaces
