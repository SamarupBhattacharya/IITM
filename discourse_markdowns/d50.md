@Saransh_Saini can you provide us the time frame for evaluation so that we know when to run ngrok. Vercel isn‚Äôt an option right now as i‚Äôm having issues deploying.
Sir, I sincerely request an extension of the deadline by just one day. I have completed the coding part, but I am facing some issues with the deployment of the project. I would really appreciate your consideration. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Stay tuned @all

What issues are you having? I am having an issue deploying due it either using up all the memory while installing dependencies or hitting some other limit. I gave up and am now hosting it on render.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand URGENT IMPORTANT QUESTION : should the link we will submit in the gform have /api in it or not :,) [ PLS DONT SCOLD IF ITS A SILLY QUESTION ]
Saransh_Saini: this the HTML file would be provide same PLEASE INFORM S S S S
Certainly! Here's a description of the image in under 50 words:

The image shows a man with short, dark hair and a slight smile. He is wearing a blue and white striped shirt and appears to be indoors, possibly in a casual setting. The background is a bit blurry but suggests a store or populated area.

please tell how long approx will evaluations will last
it depends on what ur post endpoint is , if its (‚Äú/api‚Äù ) then give that
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini same question
same here , It worked fine for a while and once the dependencies grew and varied it started showing serverless function crashed though it was running fine locally
I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I‚Äôm wondering if we can continue using it. If your team was aware of this, I‚Äôd like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn‚Äôt support certain features. what to do now
Just extend the deadline for one day please it will be a great help for many students
ngrok will give me 0 marks right because when ever your system try to evaluated it get offline message still i am very thankful for this project i created mini chatgpt without using any llm api instead of prompt engineer
pls sir extend the deadline by 1 day
it wont disconnect in 2hours , if u login using ur id to ngrok and start ur server with auth id , it will keep running as long as ur pc is on
use screen package to keep it running
yes me too Thank You for some sleepless nights(now I have some dark-circlesüòë) and this wonderful experience @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj

Thank you @21f2000709 @trebhuvansb @ItsMeAlex without you guys, i don;t know what i would have done. THANK YOU
Ah, the true mark of a dedicated developer‚Äîwhen even your dreams come with syntax errors! This project was a rollercoaster of caffeine, code, and existential debugging at 3 AM. But hey, we survived, and now even my subconscious is running python main.py on repeat. On to the next adventure‚Ä¶ after some well-earned sleep (hopefully bug-free)!
The image displays a bright yellow emoji face expressing intense laughter. Its eyes are squinted tightly shut in an "X" shape, and its open mouth reveals a wide grin, showcasing both teeth and tongue. The overall expression indicates extreme amusement and joy.
