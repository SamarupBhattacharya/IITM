The image shows a quiz interface with instructions emphasizing open-resource use, regular saving, and even hints at hackability. A user is logged in, and their recent save scores are displayed.  Below, there's a displayed JSON response, suggesting someone might be examining network requests, possibly as hinted in the instructions.
From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running. For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit Kind regards Jivraj
that means at every time i need to run the system at backend when i submit. hows that possible it requires very lengthy process. When i had submitted thats showing correct again i have reloaded the previous one showing wrong.

They've entered an ngrok URL (https://4d63-2409-40d0-100e-46d9-419e-d652-5b0e-f8fe.ngrok-free.app/), but are receiving an error: "Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524", indicating a problem with the server's JSON response.

The image shows a web page for an exam asking the user to provide a ngrok URL after creating a tunnel for a Llamafile server. The user has input an ngrok URL, but an error message appears indicating "Error: Response is not valid JSON" and "Unsupported method ('POST')", suggesting a server-side issue preventing the form submission. The score is 5.5/10, and the due date is January 26, 2025.
image 1566×912 46.1 KB I tried using github codespace for ngrok  and cmd for llamafile, but im still encountering the same error no matter which port i use @Jivraj
The image shows an ERR_NGROK_8012 error indicating that while traffic was tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `undefined://localhost:52525`. The error message suggests ensuring a web service is running at that address for the ngrok agent to connect.
Hi Naman, error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It) . I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine. @s.anand Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.
Hi daniyal, Tools in Data Science you can get calendra invite link from here and add to google calendra.
Hi Srividhya, This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay ERR_NGROK_501 | ngrok documentation . I think you didn’t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page Quickstart | ngrok documentation to authenticate. kind regards Jivraj
Hi Irina, This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine. Here is reference of error ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation kind regards Jivraj
@Jivraj @s.anand Dear Sir, could you please let me know how to proceed with this as I’m still getting the same error.
@Jivraj @carlton sir please reply
Regarding question no. 9 Web Framework: FastAPI. I got the following error for the answer to the question image 602×222 67.7 KB But when I run the url in my browser  I got the following response image 602×320 48 KB I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I don’t find any difference. @carlton can you clarify where went wrong
The image displays instructions for a FastAPI API endpoint, specifically how to filter students by class using the `class` query parameter.  It highlights enabling CORS and shows an example URL, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. An error message indicates a mismatch between the expected response and the actual undefined response from the API call, related to student data including student ID and class.
The image shows a JSON response from a local server (127.0.0.1:8000). The response contains a list of student objects, each with a "studentId" and a "class" field. The URL query parameters suggest the API is filtering students by class ("6X", "5T", "78", "2Z").

Thank You Now it’s working and I have Done Everything. But just a Question while doing it last time i had my own webpage for llama open is their any chance it could made issue even if i was not using it, it was just open. because this time , before submitting i closed it first, i don’t know why but just did and it went well.
Can any one help me to fix the following error in respect to answer to question 10 image 1326×349 8.53 KB

The image shows a quiz interface with instructions emphasizing flexibility. Students are encouraged to use resources, check answers, and save progress. It also acknowledges that the quiz is "hackable". The logged-in user has recent saves, and a debug console shows an API endpoint, possibly related to accessing quiz data.
Hi Shouvik, This ERR_NGROK_3200 error suggests that ngrok tunnel is not active at the moment. kind regards Jivraj
