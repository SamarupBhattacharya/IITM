Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.
2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions. When I logged in today it says score is 0. Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again? Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links? If [seek] ( Nptel Seekh ) can access [TDS exam] ( Technical Assessment ) then why we need to submit from seek?
The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regards
The image shows a bright blue button with rounded corners. The word "Save" is displayed in white, centered on the button. The letters appear to have a slightly glowing or highlighted effect, making them stand out against the blue background. It likely represents a call to action button within a user interface.

The image shows a glossy, light green square with a white checkmark inside. The checkmark is thick and slightly angled, suggesting confirmation, completion, or approval. The overall design is simple and commonly used as a symbol to indicate correctness or selection.

Thanks @carlton . I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect. My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)
Hi @Nelson Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes). Kind regards
It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value . There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value . Kind regards
I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question. It gives the error: Error: Got [[121510.39]]... Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.
The image shows a yellow emoji with a thoughtful expression. The emoji has a furrowed brow and its hand is resting on its chin, indicating it is in deep thought or pondering something. It conveys a sense of contemplation and introspection.

Hi Nelson, I checked your set of questions, you are using wrong query to get answer. kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj In this picture for the given question i have tried in python and chatgpt both are giving same answer still showing wrong. GA1 question Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board Instagram Story 1080×1920 119 KB
The image displays a coding problem: calculating the number of Wednesdays between 1986-08-09 and 2012-06-19. A Python script imports `datetime` to iterate through dates, incrementing a `wednesday_count`. The program outputs a value for Wednesdays in the specified range. The given answer, 1349, is marked incorrect in the first try.
@Jivraj @carlton The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong. Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post 1080×1080 126 KB
The image shows a Python script on the left and a YouTube video about character encoding on the right. The script reads data from CSV and TXT files, detects their encoding, and calculates the sum of values associated with specific symbols.  The calculated sum, 31532.0, is printed at the end. The script also handles potential errors like file not found or decoding issues.

Hi Shouvik, Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box. Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out. kind regards
yeah thank you sir. now please say for the 2nd problem
Try copy pasting exact symbols — OR † OR € Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present. Also have a look at what all_content variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

Hi Jivraj, I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the screenshot for your reference. Screenshot 2025-01-13 224057 1005×714 27.3 KB Thanks
The image displays a browser error message indicating an interrupted internet connection. The message states, "Your connection was interrupted" and "A network change was detected." The error code displayed is "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED." A broken connection icon appears at the top of the screen, and a "Refresh" button is provided.

One unicode character is in both UPPERCASE and lowercase. Do a case sensitive search.
@Samra this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network. (I face this problem at office often. Once, our company’s firewall blocked our own company website )
The image shows a yellow circular emoji with a noticeably sad expression. Its eyes are dark brown and wide, while its mouth is depicted by a downward-curved line, conveying feelings of sadness, disappointment, or concern. Overall, it represents a state of unhappiness.

Hi Nelson, I checked with your dataset for this particular question. Using correct query I am able to get correct answer. Pls check sql query that you are using. Kind regards
