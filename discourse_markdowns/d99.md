Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.
Sir, could you please fetch my latest GitHub commit before 18th Feb and build the image through that one? I received a mail saying that the Docker image is not accessible, but it is already there. Kindly request you to evaluate my submission.

Hi @23f1000879 This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.” If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page? We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!! Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.
@carlton @Jivraj Dear Sir, I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found. I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  has an invisible Unicode non-breaking space ( U+00A0 ) between "run", "app.py" instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command. I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE.  Expecting a positive response from your end.
sir, but before submission i run evluate.py and it gave me 8/10 in task A. after submission i also got result mail stating that i got 8/20. image 1895×938 90 KB also this mail result Earlier i got From your side.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag "abhay227/version1" instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74 , which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available. Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project.  I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

@carlton and @Jivraj , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available. Could you rerun the test ?
Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: "Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!"
same for me my roll number is 23f1003094
Same with me sir @carlton
There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query? Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   … Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed. You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link. Kind regards

You can take it up with @s.anand I did not come up with the standard. And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol. Kindest regards.
