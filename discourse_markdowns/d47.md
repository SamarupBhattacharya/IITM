reconstructed_jigsaw 500×500 476 KB through this i got this image in my file output directly and is your internal server capable of extracted from given location or we have to handle this internally
The image depicts a futuristic cityscape with towering, neon-lit skyscrapers, flying vehicles, and multi-layered highways glowing with pink and blue light. The scene evokes a sense of advanced technology and bustling urban activity in a vibrant, imaginative world.
I am going to clarify this once and for all The response should be a JSON Object with the value of the "answer" key as a string. { "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" } This is the way we are expecting your responses. However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don’t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error. So, "{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}" is also valid.
means {‘answer’:‘E://data science too//GA5/output/vicky.jpg’} right or we have to do you said output as base64
@Algsoch We should receive your images as base64 encoded within your response JSON object.
No, we won’t be able to access your images from your local machine address.
i cannot use github as file goes to 18gb what is solution for it as you are asking for github but i created repo there is only main file vicky_server.py,copy_tds.py can you explain how to solve this problem and i will use ngrok so we have to open that till you check and how i know that you will check my api that time or when as vercel don’t supported it
@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3 What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under /telugu/ from 11:00 until before 20:00 on Mondays? For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - 2698 However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question. Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong. My script: import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count I had extracted and uploaded the data after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script. The other script: import pandas as pd
import gzip
import re
import os
from datetime import datetime
import hashlib
from google.colab import files

# Function to compute SHA-256 hash
def compute_hash(text):

def parse_log_line(line):
    log_pattern = (r'^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?) (\S+)" (\d+) (\S+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)" (\S+) (\S+)$')
    match = re.match(log_pattern, line)
    if match:
        return {
            "ip": match.group(1),

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &

    ]

    # Compute hash of the result
    result_hash = compute_hash(str(len(filtered_df)))

    # Output the count and hash
    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.") Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.
can anyone help me , Screenshot 2025-03-31 064538 1172×815 101 KB Screenshot 2025-03-31 064552 913×119 3.63 KB
The image shows an "Academic Verification" form. It requires name, country, and school name as per school records. First and last names are "Vikash" and "Prasad" respectively. The country selected is "India", and the school name is "Indian Institute of Technology Madras". This is likely a form for a student to verify their academic status with Microsoft.
The image displays a form field labeled "School email address". The field contains the email address "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", likely representing a student's email at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, specifically within the "ds.study" domain.
Hi, i deployed the application the application in render. It is free for 750 hours per month. But it is saying if the application is inactive mode, it will be go spin-off mode and take some 50 seconds to respond to the first query from inactive mode. is that ok? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
do we have additional sample question request formats available then what is listed on the project description page? kindly assist. thank you.
Screenshot 2025-03-31 074845 1267×351 16.2 KB is the port is correct @Jivraj
The image shows settings for inbound port rules for a virtual machine. It's configured to "Allow selected ports," specifically SSH (22). A warning message indicates that this setup will allow all IP addresses access and is recommended for testing only. Users should use advanced controls to limit access to known IP addresses.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Respected Sir, We kindly request a one-day extension for Project 2, as we finished with vivas and OPPE yesterday only. The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline. We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. Best regards
Yes please extend the deadline for project 2, as it was very lengthy and we have other exams as well with that. @s.anand , @carlton @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton Respected Sirs, Please consider the extension for Project 2 submission…
Good morning sir, Could you please extend the deadline for Project 2 as today(31/03/2025) is the last day of submission and it clashes with “Eid al-Fitr”. I have small portion of work left but it won’t be possible as there is frequent visit of guests and friends. Could you please extend the deadline till 02/04/2025, this will give us enough amount of time to complete the project after our festival. Thank you
@carlton , please this much support we deserve from you
Pls sir extend the deadline it’s very hectic schedule for all of us  to complete by today. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
Sir, could you please extend the deadline by one day? I’m facing some issues with deployment, and with Eid celebrations at home, it’s been a bit difficult to manage everything. I would really appreciate your consideration. Thank you! @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand
Sir many of us had OPPEs and Programming projects due this weekend and thus an extension in the deadline will be helpful
hi sir. Im also on the same boat.
