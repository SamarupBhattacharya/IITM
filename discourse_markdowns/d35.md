Please refer to this post. URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science Hi Premdeep, 
We will update your score to consider \n for SQL query. 
I had briefly read your post and incorrectly assumed that the script was not handling newline characters (which are invisible whitespaces). 
The prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear. 
We should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This qu… Your logs have been shared with you. But I have pasted it here as a reference. [

] It is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. We have you scored currently at 12 out of 20. You asked for a fair evaluation. You actually should be scored 8 out of 20 , reducing your T score from 82 to 78, just out of maintaining the principle of fairly evaluating everyone. This will result in a grade change for you. If you still want a fair evaluation we are happy to forward your request to operations. @jkmadathil has been consulted on this and course team together has looked at your grievance and we have made it publicly visible so that it can be judged fairly. Kind regards
Here's a 50-word summary of the image:

The image shows a headshot of a man with short, dark hair, wearing glasses and a purple shirt. He's smiling gently. The background is a pale yellow or beige color, creating a simple and clean portrait. The lighting appears to be soft and even.

Hi @23f1002997 It’s unfortunate that you had to go through this, but since it was your mistake to not update your URL despite repeated notifications, under whatever assumptions, there is nothing we can do. I can understand that a small mistake like this has lead to a setback for a term, and honestly I can relate very strongly with this. But take it as a life lesson and try to score well in the next term. Best wishes Saransh Saini
Hi @Algsoch , Case 1: This might be an error. Send me your github pages endpoint I’ll have a look. Case 2: Question asked for the recent post where 2FA was mentioned with at least 95 points. Case 3: Question asked for the number of times key “Y” appears.
Hi @23f1001231 Your submission was validated by the course portal, so it testifies its correctness. But I want to clarify our side. I checked your response. The problem is not that your tag is present in <a> tags. Its because your closing email_off tag doesn’t have a slash as mentioned in the question page. Moreover this was specifically mentioned in the question we sent you in the API request. "Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work. Ensure that your email address 23f1001231@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is in the page's HTML. GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails. So, wrap your email address inside a: <!--email_off-->23f1001231@ds.study.iitm.ac.in<!--/email_off--> What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/" So, in short it wasn’t a bug in our script, rather leniency given by the course portal.
The image displays an email address masked within HTML comments.  The address is "22f1001123@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The surrounding text "<!-email_off-->" and "<!-/email_off-->" indicate that this is likely a technique to prevent email harvesting by bots on a website.

The image represents a GitHub repository named "algsoch/portfolio-1744830932," associated with the portfolio page for the email address 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in. The repository has one contributor, no issues, stars, or forks. A birthday celebration photo is included, featuring an individual standing in front of birthday decorations.
@carlton please look into this!!!

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below Screenshot 2025-04-12 115342 1466×702 50.4 KB Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave, uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 As I dont have evaluate.py But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir. Please guide me after this sir Thank You So much sir Sir, I already posted before 10 days, I didn’t get any reply. I am posting again
This image displays the output of a Docker build process, which involves extracting layers, copying files, installing requirements with pip, and exporting the resulting image. Afterwards, the image is run with a Docker command, successfully starting a Uvicorn server on port 8000. Build details and the running command are displayed.
Good Afternoon Sir. This is regarding project 1 and project 2. Project-1 Evaluation Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully. Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You Sir, I have filled the E-Mail for discrepancy, but there is no change. Please help me out sir. Thank You
Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile ) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
