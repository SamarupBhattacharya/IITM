A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A. For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?
@carlton @Jivraj Please respond .
When will the project session be held? If I have missed it, can I get the recording? @carlton
Tuesday is when we are currently planning a project session. Kind regards
Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM. Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal. The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks. We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday. Kind regards
the last date of project submission is gonne get extended?
Project 1 was released over a month ago. So there will be no extension for Project 1

@carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also? Some questions about ‚ÄòB‚Äô group tasks: Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will datagen.py also generate files for these? Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned? Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API? B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database B7. Compress or resize an image B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file B9. Convert Markdown to HTML B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data
its expecting to  match every single detail in that even " and ‚Äô . in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks. llm will only handle  -calling function based on query and parameter   . What is it going to do about the logic of functions. If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir @carlton @s.anand üî¥ /data/contacts-sorted.json

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn‚Äôt a single full-fledged project session. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
Yes. I am very worried about this project. I have been trying to do this. But have gotten nowhere until now.
@carlton sir I request you demonstrate atleast few tasks, I spent last 2 days trying to implement but din‚Äôt reach anywhere, its really demotivating sir.
Can you please demonstrate it by just doing One task or provide sample example code of 1 similar task in the way you explained here. It will be very helpful right now it is very confusing.
We will be doing project session on Tuesday 9 Feb [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks @23f1002382 @23f2000237 ) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3. We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3. The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest. Kind regards
