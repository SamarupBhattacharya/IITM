Hi @carlton sir, I have not got any mail for the ROE exam yet. Can you please check this out and conform me. And also tell us, how will we access the exam.
I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.
Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.
Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards, Lakshay
Yes sir it will be helpful for us
Yes @carlton sir, please look into it and we request you to extend the allotted time.
“If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried” Found this to be funny!
The image is a yellow "Face with Tears of Joy" emoji. It features a wide, open mouth showing teeth and tongue, eyes squeezed shut, and large tears welling up and dripping from the eyes. The expression conveys unrestrained laughter, amusement, or extreme joy.

The image shows a yellow emoji face with a wide, open-mouthed smile. The eyes are squeezed shut with wrinkles, and two bright blue tears are streaming down the face. It represents uncontrollable laughter, often referred to as "laughing so hard you cry," expressing amusement and joy.

Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.
Can we team up with you in roe ???
@carlton Can you please share the pdf that you were showing in today’s meeting
Hi @23f1001231 link is now available in the first post of this thread.

SecurePrompt Technologies, a cybersecurity firm, tests LLMs for adherence to security policies by simulating attacks. The task involves bypassing a constraint where the LLM is forbidden from saying "Yes". The objective is to craft a prompt that tricks the LLM into uttering the prohibited word, validating security loopholes.
Hi @23f1001231 Here is a blog post made by Anand Sir Hacking an obnoxious, unhelpful LLM to say Yes - S Anand Give it a read, it would be helpful.

mock 4 for tds roe exam
Hi, I have started attempting the MOCKs, But I don’t know how to scrap the data from the link which is provided for MOCK 1. I couldn’t find this in recorded sessions as well. Anyone please suggest a way to do it.
agreed, the time is very less we can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
import json

with open("regions.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

pickup_locations = [
    (6.488, -78.0287),
    (32.0198, -99.7243),
    (16.7257, -58.7811),
    (1.9307, 45.4928),
    (-34.6289, 133.0359)
]

cities = data["cities"]
regions = data["regions"]

matching_regions = []

for request_point in pickup_locations:
    point = Point(request_point)
    region_num = 1

    for region in regions:
        region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region]
        region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates)

        if region_polygon.contains(point):
            matching_regions.append(str(region_num))
            break  # Stop checking once a match is found
        region_num += 1

print(",".join(matching_regions)) I have been trying this for the past 1 day and i still cant get the answer for mock roe 2, q5 2 of my coordinates r not giving any value can someone please help @carlton
The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
