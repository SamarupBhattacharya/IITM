Thank you, Sir! What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

The image displays a developer working on an API that filters students by class. The browser shows the API endpoint being tested with the query parameter "class=15", successfully returning students from class 15. A terminal window displays server logs, showing various API requests and their corresponding responses including OPTIONS requests, indicating CORS support. Documentation on the right explains the expected behavior of the API and its endpoint. An error response is displayed below, with data of students and the classes they belong to.
Hi Mishkat, The GA url encoded parameter is class In your screenshot, you are using class_ Your code that we examined earlier also accepts class_ as the parameter instead of class as required by the GA The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter class

The image shows an error page from ngrok, labeled ERR_NGROK_8012.  Ngrok successfully tunneled traffic, but the agent failed to connect to the web service at `http://localhost:5000` due to a connection refusal. The page suggests developers ensure a web service is running on that address. Visitors are advised to refresh.

Hi Mishkat, In your code, the word class is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem. Kind regards
Hi Team , For GA - 2 , Question 6: I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel. And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser. But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error. Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM 3570×1344 436 KB I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin. I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal. Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here. Thanks Kushagra
The image shows a task involving deploying a Python app to Vercel with an API.  The task requires creating a GitHub Action and exposing an API endpoint.  The user seems to be facing a "TypeError: NetworkError" when trying to fetch the resource, and is inspecting the network requests in the browser's developer tools.  A CORS error is also indicated.
image 1747×186 10.6 KB Hello, this is working when I put in parameters, but not when I submit on quiz portal. What to do?
The image displays a web form field labeled "What is the Vercel URL?" It shows an example URL format: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The input field contains `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api`, highlighted in red, alongside an error icon.  Below, a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" message indicates an issue retrieving data or connecting to the specified URL.
Hi @carlton @Jivraj , Can you please help on this one.
Hi Kushagra, can you share vercel url so that I can test. Kind regards
Hi Aindree, I tried to send a request to your application https://your-app2.vercel.app/api with url encoded parameter class=7Q . It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends {"marks": []} . Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct. Kind regards Jivraj
For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue @s.anand
Hi Tushar, For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running. For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission. Kind regards Jivraj
https://your-app2.vercel.app/api?name=gy5&name=nk&name=ySOPVNRtt is the one I tried. Somehow it worked correctly at my end. I’ll recheck though. Thanks
Hi Jivraj, I tried with another public url, It is working for me now. Thanks Kushagra
Hi, I have downloaded the Llamafile as instructed. But I can’t run it on my mac. It says command not found. Pls let me know what I should do.
For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes. Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions. image 830×156 10.3 KB
The image shows an error message during file upload. The system requires a losslessly compressed image under 1,500 bytes. The user selected "shapes_compressed.png", but an error occurred: "Could not process image... Image pixels do not match the original." It suggests either an unsupported image format or pixel data mismatch.
this mainly happens when ngrok able to tunnel to given port but nothing is running on that port,so check that first
i am getting this error image 1636×415 30 KB i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output. image 1065×178 7.32 KB @Jivraj @carlton
The image displays instructions for deploying a Python application on Vercel. The app should expose an API that returns student marks in JSON format based on name parameters in the request. It also shows an attempted Vercel URL with a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem with accessing the deployed application.

The image displays a JSON response from an API endpoint hosted on Vercel, focused on student marks. The API, located at "student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api", returns a JSON object containing an array of marks.  The "marks" array contains two integer values: 65 and 74. The "Pretty-print" is enabled.
Hi Tushar, Make sure cors are enabled, if so can you share screenshot of console tab in browser? kind regards Jivraj
