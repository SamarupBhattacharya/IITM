We will be pushing marks today.
I probably wasn’t 1 of the 4, right? Anyways thanks for paying attention to the matter. Regards, Shivaditya
@carlton @Jivraj Respected Sir, I hope you are doing well. This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future. So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, S. Sharmile Roll No: 23f3001688
Sir, my marks still did not get updated, please help me in that regard.
Hi Everyone, We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score. Thanks & Kind regards
Sir, my project 1 marks are still 0 even though I had passsd few cases. Please help me sir as my final score is coming as 69.8 , it will be very valuable for me if it crosses 70, please sir help me with this regard
@carlton Hi Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing Project1 , but I accidentally named the Dockerfile as dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’). Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it. Thank you! My discourse post for more information: Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1 @carlton @Jivraj Sir, 
Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind. 
Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested.
