my score from week 2 to week 5 are still showing not submitted. Screenshot 2025-02-22 181257 1144Ã—704 30.8 KB
The image shows a course progress interface with modules like "Development Tools" and "Deployment Tools". Module 2 has an assignment, "Graded Assignment 2", due Feb 2, 2025, that has not been submitted yet. The interface displays 'Your Score,' 'Peer Average,' and 'Median Score,' but these are currently empty for the assignment.
@23f1000879 This is not the screen where you see your scores for Tools in Data Science. Its only shown on dashboard. Can you send a screenshot of your dashboard. Thanks Kind regards
