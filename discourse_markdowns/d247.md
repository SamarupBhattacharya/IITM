because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence. Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 11.59.39 am 2630×288 17.6 KB Kind regards

@carlton sir, I recently checked my marks for Tool in Data Science and noticed a major discrepancy. In the subject dashboard, my marks are shown as 100  , but in the main Dashboard, I have been awarded absent .

Module 1, "Development Tools," shows that Graded Assignment 1 was submitted by the deadline (26 Jan 2025). The student scored 100, compared to a peer average of 99%, and a median score of 100.  Charts are available for further insights. The next section is Module 2: Deployment Tools.
The image displays a dashboard from IIT Madras' Data Science and Applications program. It shows four courses: Business Data Management, Tools in Data Science, Modern Application Development I, and Machine Learning Techniques. Assignment grades for some courses are visible, along with links to each course page.
@23f2004320 I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1. Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks. The actual score will be in the dashboard soon. Kind regards.
Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4.
@23f1002223 Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 7.52.54 am 2622×274 23.1 KB According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100) Kind regards
The image displays tabular data with three entries. Each row includes an identifier "tds-2025-01-ga3", an email address "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", a timestamp in February 2025, a numeric value (4.5 or 3.5), and the constant value 9.5.
@carlton , the error has been rectified, and the corrected mark has now been accurately reflected in the system.
w2tdse 1100×886 50.3 KB Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab. I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
The image shows a graded assignment interface, likely from IIT Madras. The assignment, named TDS 2025 Jan GA2, ended on Feb 2, 2025. The logged-in user, 22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, has a score of 0, but can reload previous saves from Feb 2-3, 2025, each with a score of 8. The assignment includes questions on writing documentation and compressing images.
@shubham6 I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you. Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks. Kind regards
