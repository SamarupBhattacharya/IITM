It seems like your server went offline for some reason when we ran evaluations on it. Keep your server running for the next 2 hours, we’ll run a re-evaluation.
Yes sure thank you so much. It is running right now
@Saransh_Saini The same thing happened to me. I have not received request from Indian ip as far as I can see on the logs. Can you please check if my server responded or not ? I am using Google cloud and the VM was running continuously…
I just now checked it ran! all 5 qs thank you so much!
Your submission was complete successfully. Even your score card has been generated.
Thank you so much sir…
@Saransh_Saini - This is 24f1001631 The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself. I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works. I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)… but i fixed it. ga1 q1 image 1378×866 65 KB ga5 q5 image 1384×644 48 KB
The image shows a POST request made using Postman to an API endpoint. The request body includes a form-data entry with the key "question" and value "Install and run Visual Studio Code in your Terminal". The response body, in JSON format, provides system information like the OS, processor, memory, and graphics settings, likely as a result of processing the initial question.
The image shows a Postman request to an API endpoint, "104.211.116.95:8080/api", using the POST method. The request body is in form-data format, containing a "question" with a text value and a "file" with a JSON document. The server responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON body containing an "answer" with the value "10687".
@Saransh_Saini Hi sir, can you check and say if my server has been evaluated? roll no.23f3000975 thank you in advance
Yes you have been evaluated.
You have been evaluated @ItsMeAlex
Thanks Saransh. PS: Just wanted to know how did u automate the testing of something like this?(Postman?)
Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses curl to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.
@Saransh_Saini Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered? also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks. thank you 1000083109 1920×1446 286 KB
The image displays a terminal output, possibly from a data science tool, showing the processing of questions with associated file paths (e.g., `third.py`, `second.py`) and scores. It indicates a series of HTTP POST requests to `/ask` with a status code of 200 OK. The questions involve topics like startups and database queries.
i am running via ngrok , and have recieved no pings yet please check
This Makes sense. Thanks.
please send complete screenshot ..
@Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir .. Please check my link sir and please use http instead of https , I have submitted the link correctly …Kindly co-operate..
Postman can’t be used for automation. Had to write a script for the entire process.
@Saransh_Saini I see a lot of 308’s as status codes in the logs I can see on render. Could you let me know if testing of my project was successful? Or if I did something wrong? My roll number is 21f2001573. (A hint on my score would be welcome. ^_^)
can u please check 23f3001787 as i havent recieved any hits on my ngrok logs
