the rating should be treated as string. Format is as “2.9” instead of number 2.9
Yes it can be done. Got the 10th one correct by implementing breakpoint by printing the expected answer which is being used to validate the user answer in the js script.
i am facing a similar issue image 1746×766 56.3 KB
The image shows a code exercise where a user is prompted to provide a JSON weather forecast for Shanghai. The expected format includes dates and weather descriptions, as shown in the first code block. The user-provided JSON code includes weather forecasts for several dates in February 2025, but it triggers an error: "At root: Different number of properties."
image 1678×892 43.3 KB succesfully completed GA4 with 10/10 Marks
This screenshot is from an online assignment, likely for an IITM BS student, due on February 9, 2025. The user has a score of 10/10. Bonus marks are offered for participation in the GA4 - Data Sourcing discussion thread. The user's recent scores are listed, with the most recent being 10. A logout option is available.
sir how will we know if we have been awarded with the bonus mark. Will it be reflected in our ga score and the marks would be 11/10 or will it be added later
In Q2. getting , able to fix most of the errors but image 1920×1080 159 KB Error: At [18].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “19. Graymail”. Actual: “19. The Recruit” this kind of errors for some titles, even though i only applied Rating filter and nothing else, then why i’m getting different titles then the test cases?
The screenshot displays a web page with IMDb search results for titles rated between 4.0 and 8.0. On the left side, movie titles with summaries are visible, like "Anora" and "Blink Twice." The right side shows a console with JSON data, including movie IDs, titles, years, and ratings, likely used by the IMDb website.
Hello Sir, thank you for changing the question. @carlton I’m getting the below error: Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words). However, in the source PDF file itself these words are not available. image 657×106 7.78 KB
The image shows two rows of Latin words like "quos," "utrum," and "videlicet," separated by vertical bars, with red squiggles underneath several words. An error message indicates that certain words (like "https," "webbed," and "impact") are either missing or not being correctly separated into individual words.
Copy the row name that is use to change and paste it in your answers
the ranking changes from time to time. you might need to scrape the data again.
i am facing issue in Q7. I am using this command : “ https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers: >120&sort=created&order=desc” and the output on evaluating is : 2011-05-07T08:30:48Z But i am getting the error : image 1889×848 113 KB Can someone please help me on this ?
The image shows a challenge using the GitHub API to find the newest user in Seattle with over 120 followers. It outlines steps involving data retrieval, processing, and formatting to identify the user's account creation date in ISO 8601 format. CodeConnect gains advantages through targeted recruitment, competitive intelligence, efficiency, and data-driven decisions. The user's attempt to input the date was incorrect. The instructions clarify search criteria and sorting method.
I am also facing the same issue. What is the problem here? image 1788×908 77.9 KB
The image shows a coding task to retrieve London's weather forecast using the BBC Weather API. The task involves API integration, data extraction, and transformation into a JSON format with "issueDate" as keys and "enhancedWeatherDescription" as values. An example and user's attempt are displayed. The attempt shows a property name mismatch error.
@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.
To evaluate the bonus mark for replying to this Discourse topic, At around the time of the deadline, we’ll close this thread, load all posts here, and run this in the Console: [...new Set($$('.names a[href^="/u/"]').map(d => d.textContent))] … to get the Discourse IDs who posted. Then we’ll match it to the email IDs and pass it to the operations team who will add it to the portal by 2025-02-22T18:30:00Z .
I am getting the error in Q4 as “Error: At root: Property name mismatch” what could me the cause of this error? Any please help. @carlton image 716×402 23.3 KB
The image displays a question asking for the JSON weather forecast description for Sao Paulo. The provided JSON includes daily weather descriptions from 2025-02-08 to 2025-02-12.  An error message "Property name mismatch" indicates a problem with the JSON structure despite seeming correct. A "Check" button is present, presumably to validate the answer.

This is the only thing which worked for me. @carlton Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is: image 1580×196 4.81 KB
The image shows a snippet of a JSON array containing movie data. Each movie object includes the id, title, year, and rating. Two movies are listed, "Movie 1" from 2021 with a rating of 5.8 and "Movie 2" from 2019 with a rating of 6.2. There are more titles in the full data set.
Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one Try to copy the value and then replace it
Try to copy the error data The problem might be off dot check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard these two dots may represent different meanings
is it resolved? i too am getting the same error,even if it was working fine yesterday.
https will be part of the link (provided ‘link’ is one of the checkpoints of evaluation)
Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction? In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST. I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.
