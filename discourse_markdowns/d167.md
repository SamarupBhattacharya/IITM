Hi @carlton , My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner. Regards, Ajit
No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by. Kind regards
@carlton any updates on the Project 1 results?
We are releasing them today. You will get an email with lots of goodies in it Kind regards

Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link. My mail id: 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding Project 1 results. Could you please confirm if there’s an issue? my mail id: 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
No issue with your submission, you will get a good score. Kind regards
Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated. Kind regards
