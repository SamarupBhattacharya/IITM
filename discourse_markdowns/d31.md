Hello Sir, I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course. I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of 80 out of 100 . However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “ absent ” for this particular assignment. I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?

The image shows a screen capture of an exam interface, which ended on January 26, 2025. The user, logged in with an IITM email, has a current score of 0.  Previous saves from the exam show a score of 8, with the most recent listed as the official score. A "Join the discussion" button is available.

The image advertises a "Tools in Data Science" course, labeled as a "New Course." Below, it states "Week 1 Assignment - Absent," suggesting someone did not complete the initial assignment. The background is a maroon color with a pattern of dots.
@s.anand Linking this tutorial for markdown. Maybe you can consider including it in the next iteration of the course? I’ve created a PR for the same on GitHub! Please have a look and let me know what you think Prof!
