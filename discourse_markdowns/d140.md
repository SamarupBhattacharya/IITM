Hi Aindree, No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was updated on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it. Thanks for bringing it to our attention. Kind regards
Hi This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.
Try using the eval() function, that seemed to work for me
@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Sir, could you please share some guidance on the above?
@jivraj , @carlton I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.
At what time will the session be happening tomorrow sir can you please give the details?
Hi @carlton @Jivraj Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task. I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query. I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays. But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response. image 618×246 6.28 KB Please advice. Thank you.

image 1215×112 19 KB On task A8, credit-card.png is given, but it is in credit_card. it makes the errors. I checked that 2 to 3 tasks depend on these, and we create the ouput file with ‘-’ this only. please clarify that output and input files name ‘-’ or ‘_’ @carlton @Jivraj

On tomorrow live sessions, kindly explain how to use docker, evaluations, github, what generally we have to do submit, please get some tuturials for us to submit those answers. Thankyou Sir @Jivraj @carlton

Score: 9 / 10 Almost done with A tasks. Please use this for local llm to verify output Also Ollama doesn’t require Schemas CHECK OUT THE REPO AND ANY INPUTS ARE WELCOME Link to ReadMe and also repo

Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Kind regards
Respected @s.anand @carlton and @Jivraj , Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns? I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest. Looking forward to your response. Thanks, Telvin Varghese

Hi, I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near. The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project. Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that. The deadline is near.
carlton: o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust. I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

carlton: keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

Hi Telvin You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2. Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm 2078×1276 305 KB In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50 As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email. Kind regards
