Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it‚Äôll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!! The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it‚Äôs just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I‚Äôve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir. @s.anand sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable. @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions. I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I‚Äôd love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms. Thanks Regards, Shivaditya Bhattacharya
Hi @22f3000819 , First of all congratulations on scoring a S grade in the subject claimed to be the hardest of all in the program, its truly a feat of its own. This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs @carlton and @Amit1 back in May‚Äô24 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term . This course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off. All the best for your next term. Best Wishes Saransh Saini TDS TA

This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all by now ). I had the technical background and as @22f3000819 mentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time. The best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things. Everything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with @ItsMeAlex , @trebhuvansb , @23f1002382 and @22f3002933 for Project 2. My Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall ‚ÄúS‚Äù grade. Also I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini and @carlton sir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by @s.anand sir and sir‚Äôs take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective. When we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities. At last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox . Thanks & Regards Pradeep Mondal

My TDS Journey ‚ÄúA Tale of Bugs, Chaos & Miraculous Comebacks‚Äù So, I did something bold (or reckless, depends on how you see it)‚Äîtook the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course right in my first term . Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, ‚ÄúEh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?‚Äù (Spoiler: Very hard.) Not a decision I recommend unless you‚Äôre into academic masochism. The first few modules hit me like three courses merged into one . Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos. Did all 7 GA ‚Ä¶it was very time consuming but fun too ‚Ä¶learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the live lectures were fantastic , the modules were well-structured , and thank goodness for the lifesaving Discourse forum and group , where the real MVPs reside . Then came Project 1 . Ah yes, my nemesis. I‚Äôd write code, it would run perfectly , then‚Äîbam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable‚ö†Ô∏è. Was it 404? 500? Who knows! I basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence . The grand result? 2/20. At this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff , and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could salvage an B‚Äîor even a C, honestly ‚Ä¶ with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn‚Äôt have expected more‚Ä¶ no? Entered the TA sessions and peer-powered survival squad ‚Äîmy saving grace. ROE, the supposedly impossible exam , where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got 100%. Same for Project 2‚Äî100%. Even after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques‚Ä¶definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks‚Ä¶ this deal got sealed with a confident A ‚Ä¶ . ‚Ä¶drumrolls‚Ä¶ An A. This course was brutal , but in the best way possible . It threw me into battles with LLMs, never-ending questions , and existential crises over debugging . But now, I have actual skills (and scars) that I‚Äôll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experienceüöÄ. Looking back, the syllabus was a wild mix of survival skills and superpowers ‚Äîbuilding models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1 pulled us into the abyss . Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn‚Äôt over. Because what‚Äôs data science without some surprises and flashy charts to flex? For future students? Take it later in the diploma , enjoy the mad ride , and remember‚Äî even if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback. TDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection. Even if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger. Massive thanks to @s.anand sir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to @carlton sir, @Saransh_Saini sir, and @Jivraj for patiently resolving our chaotic issues . Your guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful. Grateful for everything! TDS‚Äîdifficult, enlightening, and totally worth it. (This gracious furry benefactor granted us a deadline extension‚ÄîP1 survivors can relate #thanks_to_carlton_sir , we know how crucial that was. So, signing off with a furry and really grateful thank you! ) image 190√ó190 35.7 KB
