I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard. Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion? image 1056Ã—289 15.4 KB
This is an email from IITM BS Team, sent to learners. It reminds them that the deadline for Week 1 and 2 Graded Assignment is January 26, 2025, at 23:59 hours. The email is sent from 'donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in' to '25t1_se2002-announce'.

Deadline for GA 2 has been shifted to 2nd Feb. Regards, TDS TA
