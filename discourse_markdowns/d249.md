The image shows a yellow emoji face with a wide, open-mouthed smile, dark brown eyes, and a single blue bead of sweat dripping down its forehead. The emoji appears to convey a mix of nervous laughter, relief, or perhaps embarrassment, suggesting a potentially awkward or stressful situation that is being handled with humor.

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments. There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.
