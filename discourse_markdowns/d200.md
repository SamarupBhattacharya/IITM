Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1): drive.google.com MOCK ROE 3.pdf Google Drive file. The estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins. All the best, TDS Team Update 3 26/02/2025 8:11 pm Dear Learner Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link: exam.sanand.workers.dev Technical Assessment There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it. After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); Do not submit or save your answers. All the best! Kind regards TDS Team Update 2 26/02/2025 11:00 am We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit). The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2. We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like). Kind regards, TDS Team Update 1 25/02/2025 7:46pm We have now closed the mock submissions. Both the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session. Announcement 25/02/2025 This same information is available in the seek portal as well. The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link: Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1 The questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link: https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6 IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end. The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm. We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins. We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight. All the best!

Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?
From where can I get today’s live sessions link
either is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations

form link not working
Yes we close it at 7:45pm We will reopen after live session tonight. Its a timed mock.
atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions
live session gmeet link is not available?
After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.
where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ? thanks
When will it reopen?
dear @carlton when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?
@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards
Thank you! will check out the session today
Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was "SRI GOBINDPUR" and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)] is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957 using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR drive.google.com df_gobindpur.csv Google Drive file. then i used margin formula as margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100 using this i got answer for 1st question as YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114 which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks
shubhamatkal: df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)] For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software shubhamatkal: which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets. Kind regards.
The image displays the letter "S" in white color against a blue background. The letter is simple in design and centered within the frame. The background appears to be a solid, uniform shade of blue.

@Jivraj @carlton “SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?
