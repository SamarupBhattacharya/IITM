Your submission have Dockerfile, LICENSE and repo exists as well, we found some problems because of redirects not handled in our script. Your submission will be evaluated.
We won’t be considering changes after deadline, our script looks for commits before deadline and fetches latest commits before deadline.
That’s not possible, anything after deadline is not appreciated.
We have updated just files names will it be considered??
same issue with me , my repo has both the dockerfile , license and is public. Please look into this . @carlton sir . @Jivraj GitHub - veershah1231/tds_proj_1: Tds project and i have made them 2 months ago and is not a new commit. 1000105386 1072×1787 256 KB
The email outlines prerequisites for Project 1, requiring a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE and Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The evaluation shows the Docker image passed, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are failing checks, resulting in a score of zero.
Did Not Receive Project 1 Score – Need Clarification Post Content: Hello, sir @carlton @Jivraj I received the evaluation email for my Project 1 Docker Image submission, but unlike my friend (who got an email with his score), my email did not include my score. My Docker image ID: 6f446c9b84da The email I received only contains logs and attachments, but no information about my actual score. in the mail recieved by my friend the score is clearly mentioned, I would really appreciate it if you could clarify my project score and let me know if it was properly evaluated. If there is any issue, I request a reconsideration of my project evaluation. Thank you for your help! Attachments: but in the email which i recieved i got the below thing , there is no information about the project score my email without score 1403×811 35.1 KB sir could you please clarify about my project score ??? waiting for the response
The image shows a red, stylized "X" on a black background. The "X" appears to have a rounded, cartoonish design with a slightly glossy or highlighted edge, giving it a three-dimensional look. It likely represents a symbol for cancellation, rejection, or an error.

The email informs a learner about the evaluation of their Docker image submission.  Missing files result in a zero score and the image has to be responsive. Several evaluation files are included, such as Docker logs and evaluation scripts. Scores are preliminary and the learner can report discrepancies by Tuesday.
I am also facing the same issue sir please provide proper answer for our query. Please consider to recheck the project once again. Docker image - 5ff55c499b54 1000161685 1080×2400 224 KB @carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini
The email informs a learner about the evaluation of their Docker image submission. It states that the 'Evaluation log file' is missing, potentially indicating a misconfiguration or failed run, resulting in a score of zero. The email also provides access to other files, including Docker, server, and evaluation script logs, for further investigation. The Docker image was expected to be responsive within 5 minutes.
@carlton @Jivraj Got a email stating that prereq failed stating below.. Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL but i can see that image is public as shown below image.. am i missing something.. image 902×177 12.2 KB
The image shows information about a project named "rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25". It was last pushed two days ago, contains an image, and has public visibility.  The "Last Pushed" column is sorted in ascending order, indicated by the upward arrow.
Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable. tags = httpx.get(
                f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{username}/{repo}/tags?ordering=last_updated",timeout = 60
            ).json()
            tag, size = next(
                (
                    (tag["name"], tag["full_size"])
                    for tag in tags.get("results", [])

Sir, The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent. image 1145×673 33.8 KB image 633×336 7.1 KB Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’. Can you please look into it. Thankyou!
The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository named "tds_project-1". It shows the repository's file structure, including directories like `_pycache_` and `venv`, as well as files like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`. The main branch is selected, and the repository has 6 commits. The last commit was creating the `LICENSE` file.

The image shows the prerequisite evaluations for Project 1. While the Docker image, Github repo, and Dockerfile are present and public, the MIT license is missing from the root of the Github repository, resulting in a "FAIL" for the prerequisites and a score of 0 for the project.
@Jivraj Can you also clarify my issue? My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log. You can check the details in the images below.

The image shows Project 1 prerequisite evaluations. The Docker image on Docker Hub passed the public check. However, the GitHub repository, the Dockerfile in the repo's root, and the MIT license in the repo's root all failed.  This results in an overall prerequisite failure and a Project 1 score of 0.

The image details access to log files following a performance test, including evaluation, Docker, and server start logs. Evaluation logs, accessible via a Google Drive link, report individual task performance. Docker log files, also on Google Drive, provide technical container performance data. Server start logs (arm/x86) are in an attachment and assist in troubleshooting Docker service issues.
The image shows a GitHub repository named "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based", maintained by "lakshay654". The repository includes files like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `task_handler.py`, with updates two months ago. The repository uses the MIT license. The main branch is currently selected.
Standard name of dockerfile is Dockerfile that’s why it didn’t pass Dockerfile check
@Jivraj @carlton I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation. I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir.
I  have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated. Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID. Roll number: 23F1001012 @carlton @Jivraj
@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 —since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj
The image lists files related to a Docker container evaluation, including evaluation and Docker logs, server start and evaluation scripts for ARM and x86, data generation, Docker orchestration, and a solution script. Google Drive links are provided for the first two, while the others are attachments. The Docker image ID is also provided.
pro 1 720×1600 81.5 KB Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks @carlton @ TDS TEAM
The image shows feedback for Project 1 prerequisites, where a submission won't be evaluated. It indicates that a Docker image is public on Dockerhub and a Github repo exists and is public, and an MIT license is present. However, the Dockerfile is missing in the Github repo's root, causing the prerequisites to fail and result in a score of 0.
There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile.
@carlton @Jivraj please let know if any issues in my end on the docker image not present issue.. As explained in earlier thread , the only reason docker image had to be pushed  was the removal my office proxies in the docker image which was making the container not to startup from orchestration environment.. any help is appreciated..
@Jivraj @carlton I updated google form 4 days ago on the architecture, Could you let me know when it will be re-evaluated ? Thanks
Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723 Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations. We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep. This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases
