The image shows an online graded assignment for an IIT Madras course. The assignment, "Graded Assignment 1," is due January 26, 2025. It provides troubleshooting tips for access issues like disabling ad blockers and enabling cookies/JavaScript.  Students must use their IITM student ID for the assignment. A question asks if the student has seen the assignment at a given link, with "Yes" or "No" options.
@RaunakThatoi @jahnavih The course content is available at Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 22.47.14 2068×788 75.4 KB At Tools in Data Science the course calendar is also available.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read everything carefully. Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg… Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 22.59.19 778×268 22.7 KB Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 23.01.49 1684×920 104 KB Kind regards
The image displays the "Course Introduction" page of an online course, possibly from IIT Madras, for the "TDS 2025 Jan Term". It has a 5/5 rating based on one review, and the course modules include "Module 1: Development Tools" and "Module 2: Deployment Tools." A link is provided for the full course.
The image shows a webpage or documentation titled "Tools in Data Science." The left panel displays a navigation menu with topics like "Development Tools," "Data Sourcing," and "Data Visualization." The right panel provides "Course Links" and "Jan 2025 Links" related to a "Tools in Data Science" course, including discourse forums, course pages, and material like Jupyter notebooks.
This image outlines expectations for a course, stating that it utilizes real-life tools but is challenging. Prior programming skills are required, and students are encouraged to share their knowledge to facilitate learning.
The image shows student feedback on a course, noting it's now quite hard, covers more content, and requires extra time compared to typical courses. Grading by LLMs is unpredictable and the ROE is difficult. A good understanding of programming and data science concepts is needed. Students should take the first graded assignment to assess readiness and consider dropping it if they score low.
I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course? image 1920×1073 124 KB Where are the weekly videos? Where and what is the assignment? I’m confused.

The image shows a man with short dark hair, wearing glasses and a purple shirt. He is smiling slightly and looking towards the camera. The background is a plain, light-colored wall. The lighting appears to be soft and even.
