Hello , I m facing problem in TDS GA2; Que 11.  I m not able to create GCP account with college ID & with personal ID it is asking to set up the auto pay. I`m attached the screenshot. Please explain how to solve thie problem &  do this question ? accounts.google.com Google Cloud Platform Google Cloud Platform lets you build, deploy, and scale applications, websites, and services on the same infrastructure as Google. Screenshot from 2025-05-19 17-11-01 1920Ã—1080 126 KB
The screenshot shows the "New Project" page in Google Cloud Platform.  A warning message indicates that the user has 12 projects remaining in their quota and needs to select a parent organization or folder. A search dialog is open, displaying "No organization" with type "Organization" and ID "0". The project name is "My Project 56623".
You have to do the google auth question with your personal email (not student id). Kind regards
