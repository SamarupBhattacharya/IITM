Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301 331×314 12.3 KB what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj
The image presents a JSON data structure describing a movie.  It includes the movie's ID ("tt7144296"), title ("1. Kiss and Kill"), year of release (2017), and rating (2.9). An error message indicates that an expected value of 2.9 was found with an actual value of 2.9.

I have the Same doubt.
@22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this: Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.
In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now? edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?
@23f2000237 A good point. Yes, please include all titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.
Q3. How to handle the error ? @Jivraj TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading ‘0’) http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/outline?country=Russia

Q4. How to handle the error ? @Jivraj Error: At 2025-02-05: Values don’t match
There is no submit button is available in below screen. Is it fine to save the link url only. Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red) image 1920×1080 337 KB
The image displays "Graded Assignment 4" details from an IIT Madras online course. The due date is February 9, 2025. Students can submit multiple times, but the final submission is graded. It advises disabling ad blockers, allowing cookies and JavaScript, and using a student ID for proper evaluation. A link to the assignment is provided.
I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10? (Assuming they have interacted in this thread)
Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a relevant message on this thread will get 11/10
The image shows a classic smiley face emoji. It features a round, bright yellow face with two dark brown, oval-shaped eyes and a simple, curved line representing a cheerful smile. It conveys happiness, positivity, and general friendliness.

For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per  video. with that data got in console worked fine. copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit
For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name image 1414×295 19 KB
The image shows a search filter interface where the title name "Un matrimonio di troppo" is entered. However, the search yields "No results found," prompting the user to adjust their filters or start a new search. A magnifying glass with an 'X' illustrates the lack of results.
how to get the BBC weather API key?
Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?
@JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.
