You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page. image 633×197 5.21 KB Kind regards
The image shows a Python traceback indicating a `KeyError`. The error occurs on line 30 of `/app/app.py` where the code attempts to retrieve the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` using `os.environ`. The `KeyError` signifies that the environment variable with that name is not set in the current environment.

You have to identify the exact bug for your claim to be considered. Thats why we have provided you with the scripts and the logs. You might get lots of marks. Its in your interest to identify the bug. Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj what do I do sir am seriously clueless and heartbroken rn pls help atleast for A tasks we should get it
We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field. Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those. If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run. Kind regards
@carlton I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail: {
"detail": "'choices'"
} This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this? Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email. Screenshot 2025-03-29 103327 1511×749 29 KB
The image displays a log indicating failures while running a script and formatting a file. Installing 'uv' and running a script from GitHub resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error. Subsequently, attempting to format the file '/data/format.md' also failed with a 500 error. Additionally, attempts to read the same file resulted in "404 Not Found" errors, signaling that the file could not be accessed.
We have given you the evaluation scripts. Identify where exactly you believe the bug is. Just guesses is not going to get you extra marks. You have to give us something specific. Kind regards
@Jivraj sir please kindly look into it. Please re-evaluate my image, everything was working fine it is an issue with the docker image. Please re-evaluate it sir and please guide me as what to do
I encountered the same issue with evaluate.py . However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with evaluate.py , I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake? Screenshot (56) 1492×362 22.9 KB
The image shows a failed test "A5" from a log file. It compares "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections. Both contain seemingly random sentences and phrases, repeated verbatim. Since they match, the test presumably aimed to verify a transformation or processing step, which failed to alter the input data as expected.
Please provide more time for this. Right now, we are also busy with the second project. There are other courses as well.
yaa same issue i am also facing , and this LLM thing is very new for us , and we tried our best to complete. , but because of local machine issue , or anything , people end up getting 0 marks , or 4-5 marks , .. As a lot of students are getting 0 , so please give some bonus , or some marking for there efforts , TDS dont have quiz , ,and getting 0 in project will decrease our CGPA too . please think for it sir @carlton
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 468630ef32b8 I believe this is not my docker ID that was submitted, my docker ID is “bd2d0e570ec6”: proof: REPOSITORY                           TAG          DIGEST                                                                    IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE rohit23f1001156/project1_tds         v3           sha256:bd2d0e570ec6b9a4a2b1565602a7c6abd118c4df06ca39e9dd78b0c06cab7542   bd2d0e570ec6   5 weeks ago    816MB Please, look over it. Also, in my docker log file, it is showing the error as: Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.10.03 AM 2360×1582 503 KB what is the reason for this? It was running properly before, please help.

The server encountered a 500 Internal Server Error while running the task "Say Hello Carlton." The error stems from a `FileNotFoundError` while trying to open "system_input.txt" within the `extract_specific_text_using_llm` function.  It appears the file does not exist in the specified directory, causing a chain of exceptions and ultimately the server error.
@ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN This is exactly what you submitted. We will ONLY consider this as valid. 2/16/2025 9:30:05	23f1001156@ds.study.iitm.ac.in GitHub - Rohit23f1001156/project1_tds rohit23f1001156/project1_tds
Yes, I agree. So, did my docker ID change when I submitted? I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong. Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me. " I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final      latest    d0f14a872042   5 weeks ago    214MB " Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct. thanks
Hi @carlton ! I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking! Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.
@carlton , Jivraj said, “We will discuss internally if we can do something about it.” I understand this well. The output from my server is slightly different, but it still achieves over 95% accuracy. Please do consider it.
Hi @Pritul_raut No, we won’t reevaluating it.
Hi @22f2001389 File "/app/app.py", line 4, in <module>
    from tasksA import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA' The error occurs because Python cannot find the tasksA module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory. Kind regards
ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN: This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 468630ef32b8 We evaluated you on correct file image 1757×250 24.9 KB ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN: what is the reason for this? It was running properly before, please help. Try running docker container after pulling, check if evaluate.py is able to do it’s job. If you feel there is some issues from our side, we have provided with scirpts we used. You can create a pull request to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1
The image shows the capital letter "R" in white with a blurry, glowing effect. It is set against a solid, dark pink or magenta background, creating a simple and contrasting design. The letter appears centered and is the main focus of the image.

The user executes `docker pull` to download an ARM64 image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`.  The pull is successful, indicated by "Downloaded newer image".  Then, `docker images | grep` confirms the image exists locally.  The image has a size of 581MB and was last updated 5 weeks ago.
The image shows the letter "R" in a white, slightly blurry or glowing font. The background is a solid, vibrant shade of pink or magenta. The letter is centered and appears to be the main focus of the image.
I’m facing “exec /usr/local/bin/uvicorn: exec format error” ,  My roll number is 21f3003062@ds.study.iitm.ac.in , My roll is in x86 list/log , not in ARM list/log. I have written and tested my code on ARM computer. I request to please check my code manually. @Jivraj @carlton .
I cannot understand why the project marks are marked zero for me ? i have used the same code as usual but the results are not same ?
