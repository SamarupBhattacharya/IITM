I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the url in different browser)
Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if name == ‘ main ’: 24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.
I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python. 1738356937481 1920×1200 92.1 KB the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem.
This is a screenshot of a Google Meet presentation where Saransh is sharing a VS Code window. The code shows a Python script named "fast.py" using the FastAPI framework to create an API endpoint. It reads data from a "data.csv" file using pandas and returns city and population data based on a query parameter.
Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj sir pls help me to fix this issue
Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.
What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots. Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.15.03 PM 1920×1200 77.8 KB Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.13.02 PM 1920×1200 178 KB
The image displays what appears to be a JSON comparison, potentially using a tool like jsondiff.com, viewed in a web browser. Two identical columns show a list of JSON objects, each containing "class" and "studentId" key-value pairs, possibly representing student data with class assignments.
The image shows a web interface for an assignment involving an API that filters students based on class. The instructions specify the API URL and desired query parameter behavior. An error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual API response. The network tab displays the API response for a specific query with a list of student IDs and classes.
if you have time, could once check my code for question 9. can send github link in chat… or run this docker pull 23f3004114/tds_2025_jan_ga2:Q9 @ 24ds1000082_Vivek
Hi @23f2004644 and @bhashwar_sengupta , You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.
Hi @23f2003853 , did you enable cors ? If yes then pls send screenshot of console and network tab. Kind regards
So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect We can’t just keep it running.
Hi @daksh76 , I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question.  I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used Squoosh , for now pls use this.
whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running.
I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”. But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.
Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek , @23f3004114 , You guys are not using correct format for response. {
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
} This is correct for which have a object with key students which is not present in your response. kind regards
That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers are running.
Yes Hari, most probably that’s what the problem is. @23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL Check if cors are enabled. Kind regards
@ carlton @ Jivraj Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem. Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect. Do I need to do anything else ? Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved. Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.
Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error image 1730×387 32.5 KB I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked This is how my docker hub repository looks, image 2239×1129 278 KB https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general
The image shows an interface prompt for a Docker image URL, with a specific URL format given as an example.  The entered URL is deemed invalid because the substring '23f2000573' is not found as a tag within the specified Docker Hub repository, resulting in an error message.  A "Check" button is also visible.

The image shows a terminal command prompt with the user "giri" on host "GIRI" executing a "docker run" command. The command is attempting to run a Docker image named "23f2000573/first-rep" with the tag "v1". After the command, "abc.py" is outputted to the terminal, likely the result of the execution of the docker container.
The image shows a Docker Hub repository named "23f2000573/first-rep." It was last pushed 19 minutes ago and has a size of 364.1 MB. The repository contains one tag, "v1," identified as an image. The "Docker commands" section displays the command to push a new tag to the repository.  There's also a section advertising automated builds.

Yes sir. I did keep them active when saving the assignment and the answers were saved successfully(The score was 10/10). I was talking about evaluation after deadline.
