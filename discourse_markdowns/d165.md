I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming the necessary libraries are installed.
@TheVishal EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled. what to do push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images how will this help? since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image @all use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion CHEERS Andrew OUT.
I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then, “The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.” I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks. This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me. Thankyou GitHub repo: GitHub - Sagankaur/TDS_project1: LLM-based automation agent Docker : sagandeep/tds_project1
Sir, can we get the evaluation script now @carlton @s.anand
If I am not wrong you were getting 9/10 in task A when many of us were stuck  and you didn’t submit… unbelievable

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules. The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable. A huge thanks to @Carlton , @Saransh_Saini , and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.
i couldn’t my code space ran out of compute and then it was just lagging before i found out what happened , i just submitted old code repo and the image the we created in week 2 or week1 when had to create docker image for graded assignments EDIT: Screenshot 2025-02-16 091101 1351×292 13.3 KB Screenshot 2025-02-17 200414 1338×200 18.2 KB Screenshot 2025-02-17 200525 1312×321 18.5 KB

Wait we had limits in codespace…I didn’t thought much of it but now that I see… …even mine is not so far from the limit…thanks for reminding…gotta be careful in next project
@carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document. Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.00.50 PM 126×226 2.02 KB

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months. I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing. Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few. I thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience. Regards, Pradeep Mondal

} It clearly says in your error message: Invalid value: ‘json’ if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top, the value cannot be “json” The error is telling you what the supported values are ‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’ Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’ So therefore you should change "type": "json" to "type": "json_schema" If you have trouble constructing Json schemas, either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors. Kind regards

@carlton Would the scores of project 1 be released tomorrow?
@Yogesh1 We do not have an ETA on Project 1 scores yet. Might have more clarity soon. Project 1 scores will be available roughly second week of March. Kind regards
@lakshaygarg654 I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes. If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair. Kind regards
We will soon provide a complete solution for Project 1 because of its valuable learning.
