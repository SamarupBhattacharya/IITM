My server shut down can you ask me to run the server again? @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
I’m running the servers now, i got a bunch hits from random ip s what is the ip address i add a verification if need be
INFO:     Shutting down INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown. INFO:     Application shutdown complete. INFO:     Finished server process [15355] INFO:     Stopping reloader process [11917] @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini . 23f1002382@ds.study.iitm.ac.in@tdsproj2:~/tds-solver_NEW$ ps -a PID TTY          TIME CMD 24617 pts/0    00:00:01 python3 24619 pts/0    00:00:00 python3 24620 pts/0    00:00:01 python3 24645 pts/0    00:00:00 ps ran it again. You can see from the process id that was actually a process that was started long back
Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script? I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses? Maybe a helpful tip for next time If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down. Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM 1340×1132 196 KB I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider. Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.
The image shows a log output. Numerous "INFO" entries indicate failed GET requests (404 Not Found) from various IP addresses, targeting common login pages and configuration files. "WARNING" messages signal invalid HTTP requests. The log concludes with the server shutting down and the application shutdown process completing.
i havent recieved any pings yet . Has it pinged everyone or is it still coming batch by batch
Now my token is expired?
They revoked token access?
My env only shut down its running again lol You have used 11 requests this month (2025-04), costing 0.01 USD. so maybe you guys have not hit my server yet im guessing
154.81.156.35:57962 this ip keeps pinging , is this the teams? @carlton @Jivraj
Just do a geographic search on the ip
Even am getting random requests from US,Netherlands, Singapore etc… what might be the reason

Hi @23f1002382 I re-ran evaluation on your endpoint, and it completed successfully.
They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed.
@carlton sir A lot of us have hosted on Azure and other platforms and were wondering by when we could expect project 2 marks so that we can take this down ? Could we have rough idea as to when the results will be available ?
@Carlton , I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details: {'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'} This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.

The image shows terminal logs from a Python application named "TDS". It indicates that a client at IP 103.158.43.17:0 first requested "favicon.ico" and then sent multiple POST requests to "/api" using HTTP/1.0. All requests were successfully processed, receiving a 200 OK status code.  The user is "azureuser" logged into the "TDS" machine.
Are the evaluations done by any chance? I havent received any requests from an Indian IP address yet…
Evals are going on. I just checked my logs, it seems like we ran evaluation on your endpoint, but it looks like your server wasn’t running.
But i tried and its working can you let me know what I can do? image 1337×754 55.1 KB image 1914×292 40.3 KB
The image shows a Postman request. The request is a POST request to the endpoint 4.213.61.248:8080/api. The request body is form-data with a key "question" and value "what is output of -s?". The response is a 200 OK with a JSON body containing system information, including OS version, CPU, and GPU details.
The image displays a JSON response, likely from an AI model like GPT, detailing a function call named "solver_1" designed to execute VS code commands. It outlines the input parameters ("command"), describes the model used (gpt-40-mini), token usage, cost, and includes an execution error: "crypto.createHash is not a function". It also shows a POST request to an API.
I have been doing this the entire day even yest and getting the output. Can you please check again
