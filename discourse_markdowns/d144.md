How did you corrected it ?
I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb
could you help later, when i need to construct docker image, via gmeet? PLEASE

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful. My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change. Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini
@22f3001777 Yes there will be one more session today (13th Feb) at usual time 8pm to 10pm Kind regards
Hi instructors and TAs, For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect. eg. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response? I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require. Thanks, Trebhuvan
Hi, Pls tell us how to use evaluate.py script to check our codes
Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function ! Kind regards
Okay sure!! Ping me when you require to generate…
Hello sir, Is yesterday’s session not uploaded to YouTube yet ? I couldn’t find it in calendar either… It will be very helpful if you (or anyone else) could provide yesterday session’s recording’s link…
21f2000709: I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb @carlton @Jivraj will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits. Earlier when I asked this: 21f2000709: Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image? I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers. I request you to please allow this time around with this size…

@carlton Could you please consider extending the submission date of Assignment 5 (it is 16th Feb right now). We are very busy with the project. And assignment 6 submission date is much later: 9th of March.
@carlton +1 Agreed, a relaxation in deadline will be a boon for students who’ve taken up other projects this term.
usage of langchain is allowed?
It will be extended, @carlton mentioned it in a TA session already.
Hi @Rishabh2 What exactly you mean by variables?  only one argument is required for running evaluate.py that’s an email address. You need to download both evaluate.py and datagen.py in same folder and then execute evaluate.py using uv. uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email . For phase B Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. 
Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function !

610 Mb’s is good size, no need to worry, it will be evaluated.
Hi @23f1002382 This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem. The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks. What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.
