The screenshot depicts an online assessment interface, likely for IITM students. The user is logged in, has 19 minutes and 29 seconds remaining, and has achieved a perfect score of 10/10.  The recent saves show previous scores. The first question is "Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)".  There are links for support via Discourse or Google Meet.
ohh ok my bad thank you
Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required. I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks. Could you please consider my request? Thank you.
Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10 solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards

image 633×512 23.8 KB Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves. Thank you.
The image displays a web page related to an online exam. The exam ended on March 2, 2025, at 1:45 pm IST, with a score of 0. The "Recent saves" section shows three save points from the same date, each with a score of 10 at slightly different times. The latest save is considered the official score.
The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop.
Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up
Hi @23f2000778 No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10. kind regards
Hi @21f3002158 I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam. Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers. There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this. Kind regards

Kind regards
Hi @22f1000535 We will be giving 2 minutes allowance, answers before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, so you submitted at 1:46 so you will get 8 out of 10.
Hi @Muthupalaniappan We have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks Kind regard
@carlton @Jivraj sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity 1000032006 1280×626 125 KB
This screenshot shows an online exam interface. The exam ended March 2, 2025, with a score of 9/10. IITM students can fill out a form before 5 pm IST for a bonus mark. The user, logged in with an IITM email, has the option to join a Discourse forum or Google Meet for questions/technical issues. The page also shows recent saves/scores.
9 marks? How were you able to crack the ROE?
Hi @24f2003130 Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with	8 marks, we will consider that. Kind regards
The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful
Ok sir Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28 I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches. Thank you
Thank you so much @Jivraj for taking time out and checking the records and considering my submission. It means a lot! Thanks & Regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama
When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue. Screenshot 2025-03-02 134049 1885×953 51.3 KB
The image shows an online exam interface where the question asks for the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B. An answer field is present, with instructions to calculate the coefficient using programming languages or Excel, rounding to three decimal places. An error message "Failed to fetch" indicates a problem, advising the user to contact the exam team. The last saved submission will be evaluated automatically.
