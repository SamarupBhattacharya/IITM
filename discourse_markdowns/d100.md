Hi Hari, Your docker failed to build. Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   … If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs. 90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo. The specific error in your case is: tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists Thats why there are no logs. Kind regards

Hello @carlton Sir, please reply to my query
We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes. Kind regards
Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup. What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end. Positive or Negative - Real world outside will make everyone realise and everyone change their opinions (including me) as the time and environment changes.
What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.
Hi I have my Dockerfile saved as dockerfile, given 0 for project 1 due to this. This doesn’t seem to be a big issue to grade me 0 for this. Kindly correct the score please.
Most common reason for during running docker image was taskA module was missing which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.
For you check failed because of the naming of Dockerfile(It was named as dockerfile(d in small).
This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located
MITALI_R: 23f1003094 While running docker image create by your github repo, we got following error taskA module missing For regenerating it follow steps that are mentioned here : Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - #316

For you naming of MIT License was not correct. This shows naming criteria for adding License. Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically when: uv run app.py is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building). my dockerfile from the repo: FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"] here u can see it installs using pip install … here it’s requiring .env file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had .env file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that .env file but as git doesn’t allow upload of .env file I couldn’t upload .env to git the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because .env file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the .env file so it didn’t build so I had to create the .env file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the .env file(it supports both .env file and environment variable one)
After filling form you didn’t double check form. Abhay222: I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID. We can’t reconsider it.

Yes problem was missing .env file, Your repo, was supposed to run in a test environment.
Yes sir, please help me
Sorry We can’t do any help, we won’t be considering for eval.
But sir, It was supposed to run right…
It Should build in any test environment using Dockerfile from your github repo.
@Jivraj please tell me what was my mistake?
