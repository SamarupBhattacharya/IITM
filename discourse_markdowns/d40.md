I am not sure how you came to that conclusion! For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond. What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct. The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question. A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable. etc.
@carlton 1 small request.. can we have 2-3 more examples in the project2 description.. so that it gets a bit more clear
Prof. Anand Live Session Alert! Date & Time: Wednesday, March 19, 2025 · 9:00 – 10:00 PM (IST) Speaker: Professor Anand Topic: Project 2 Q&A + General Course Queries Google Meet Link: Join Here ( https://meet.google.com/jdr-pquo-vza ) Or from the TDS Google Calendar @all
The image shows an analog clock. It has a light blue circular frame, a white face, and black hands. The short hour hand points towards the "9", and the longer minute hand points directly at the "12". Therefore, the clock is displaying the time 9:00.

The image shows a gray dynamic microphone against a black background. It has a round mesh head with a light blue band, a slender body with a switch on it. The microphone appears to be of a standard handheld type, commonly used for singing or speaking.
The image shows a red pushpin against a black background. The pushpin has a round, flat head that is red in color, and a short, pointed pin that is light gray. It is depicted in a simple, cartoonish style with visible pixelation. The pushpin is angled slightly to the left.

The image shows a stylized, single chain link. It's rendered in a light blue color with darker blue shading to give it a slightly metallic or plastic appearance. The link is against a solid black background, emphasizing its shape and color.

Just to be clear the special Session is tonight Wed, 19th March at 9pm.

Hi TAs, I attended the meet which happened today. But I don’t clearly get one thing. Most of the questions have a question text and a file: csv,zip,json,etc My doubt is, will the request to the end point be : curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting" my doubt : Is this the only format or can there be other too ?
Hi @23f2000573 Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file. You can send a file from local machine like this -F "file=@abcd.zip" so here abcd.zip must be in current working directory. Kind regards
Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly. FILES The data file sent to the api will always be in the requester’s local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format? Or Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png This link was take from GA2 Question 2 HTML AND TABLE Some questions have html and tables . In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string. Example for string. Consider the table Col 1 Col 2 Row 1, Col1 Row 1 Col 2 Row 2, Col 1 Row 2 Col 2 Will this be something like this "|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|" or something like "<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
" HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS In one question, there were two tasks. Find the answer to the question Enable the disabled text block In this question, what will the answer type be? Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block MORE THAN ONE FILE Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table. In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" CORS HEADERS Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?
Hi, In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question. import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}') Is this the code for others as well? Thanks
So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following: → the set of question-answers pairs at first → All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions → Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step. Till now I have created the following: → Identification of the question, using embeddings → extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question → Implementation of 3 questions using this approach If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time. *Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time
The image shows a classic smiley face emoji. It's a round, bright yellow face with simple features: two oval eyes and a gentle, curved smile. The expression is cheerful and conveys happiness or contentment. It's a universally recognized symbol of positivity.

Or Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA. 23f2000573: "<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table> This is correct html table format. 23f2000573: Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block It will be just answer. 23f2000573: Some questions have more than one file.

  -F "file= table file/ string" In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2. 23f2000573: Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different? I didn’t get this question, could you point to exact question?
The image features a white, capital letter "G" against a solid purple background. The letter has a slightly blurred or out-of-focus appearance, giving it a soft edge. It appears to be centered within the frame.

Hi @22f3001307 yes it’s same code.
Sir, a few things are not yet clear . Jivraj: file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA. Some questions have clickable html buttons . When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded Some questions have image attached to the text . For this, we have to use right click → download the image . Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png . My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command Will it be “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and “file= https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png ” for the second type Jivraj: This is correct html table format. Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute Jivraj: In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2. so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

Sir @Jivraj was yesterday (March 19) 's google meet recorded and available  for replay..
@22f3002723
The image shows a man named Anand S using Google Meet. He has gray hair and is wearing a headset with a microphone. The background is a white wall with an electrical outlet. There is also something circular on the wall behind him.
thanks a lot @23f1001231
Hi @23f2000573 23f2000573: Will it be “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and “file= https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png” for the second type Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine. 23f2000573: so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute? For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with | characters. Kind regards
The image features a white letter "G" in a simple, rounded font. It is centered against a solid, vibrant purple background. The letter appears to have a slight blur or glow effect around it.

For GA 1, question 2 Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM 960×336 28.9 KB The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using \" inside the answer like this. But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case? @carlton @Jivraj
The image shows instructions to install `httpie` with a Python package, then send a HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with the `email` parameter set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. It asks for the JSON output and shows the beginning of the answer that contains the arguments and the headers.
The image shows a JSON response labeled "answer."  The content includes nested "args" and "headers" dictionaries.  The "args" dictionary contains an "email" key with a value of "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".  The "headers" dictionary has entries for "Accept" and "Accept-Encoding", along with others.

Hi @21f2000709 image 654×681 13.1 KB This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.
The code demonstrates how to work with JSON data in Python. Initially, `jobj` is assigned a string representation of a JSON object. Using `json.loads()`, the string is parsed into a Python dictionary. The code then accesses a specific value using the 'name' key, and confirms that `jobj` remains a string after all of the operation.
The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back. We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting. Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png 1744×1084 147 KB
The Python code defines a dictionary `response` with a nested structure containing a challenge question.  It then uses the `json` library to convert the dictionary to a JSON string.  The code then parses this JSON string back into a dictionary, extracts the value of the 'answer' key and then further extracts from the args key the actual challenge.  Finally, the code prints an enthusiastic message, seemingly celebrating the successful extraction.
