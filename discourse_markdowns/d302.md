I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency. The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card? Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

The image shows a single white letter "S" displayed against a solid dark teal or green background. The letter has a slightly blurred or soft-edged appearance, giving it a subtle glow or highlighted effect. 

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course, I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify
New ones wont be considered
