Hi @23f2004781 I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission. 23f2004781: There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline. image 1130×240 10.2 KB Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.
The image shows the uppercase letter "D" in a light, possibly white or slightly shaded color. The background is a solid, muted purple. The letter is centered and has a simple, clean font design.

The image is a call to action for IITM students seeking help. General questions should be directed to the Discourse forum, exclusively for IITM students. For technical issues, students can optionally join a Google Meet session, also restricted to IITM students.
I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow. @s.anand @carlton @iamprasna @Saransh_Saini
Hi @Jayeshbansal Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline. I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated. Kind regards
i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)
Hi @Jayeshbansal After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions. Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline Quiz Email Time Total Max tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:29:49 9 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:26:52 8 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:26:48 8 10 tds-2025-01-roe roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 2025-03-02 19:25:36 0 0 Kind regards
Hello sir, @Jivraj Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?
Yes, it won’t be considered.
yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save
Sorry @Jayeshbansal All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation. Kind regards
Hi @23f3002537 The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version. from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
Hello @Jivraj sir, Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question. I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic. Please re consider this request sir.
@Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini When will the results of ROE will out.
Probably, by this week
I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it. Regards
Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47). Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered. I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm. Please reconsider if possible. @Jivraj @carlton
Thank you, much appreciated.
Hi @Yogesh1 @24f2003130 @Muthupalaniappan Quick update:  I discussed with internal team we are now giving an allowance till 1:48:00. Kind regards
Hi @Jivraj sir, I sincerely appreciate the extension and the understanding from the course team. This really means a lot, and I am truly grateful for the support. Thank you for your time and effort in making this possible. Kind regards, Shambhavi Verma
Thanks a lot for this.
