Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename. However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir. Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.
The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form. But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image. Kind regards
I recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1. However, I have ensured that my Docker image is publicly accessible. Please help. @carlton My Docker image ID is " 99d08f2002fa ", and it is set to public. I kindly request you to review this issue, as I have worked very hard on this project and would appreciate the opportunity for a fair evaluation.
can you share the sha?
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again? 1000430602 1080×2412 160 KB I’ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites. Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.
The email informs a learner that their Project 1 submission failed prerequisite checks. While the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository is not public or does not have a Dockerfile and MIT license in its root. Consequently, the project received a score of 0.
@Jivraj @carlton please kindly re-pull my docker image and re-evaluate my project sir. I fixed the issue long back. Please reply kindly. My roll no is : 22f2001389. I have been trying to get to you for long now. Please kindly help me out. Please reply.
@carlton I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check: “Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?” Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository. Github repo link: GitHub - Vansh-22f300/project_tds My evaluation.log , contains the score .

This image shows a GitHub repository named "Vansh-22f300" with an MIT license. The repository has no stars or forks but one watcher and one branch. The listed files and folders, including Python scripts (app.py, datagen.py, evaluate.py, tasksA.py, tasksB.py), a Dockerfile, and environment/gitignore files, were last modified two months ago.
dockerfile is spelling mistake it should be Dockerfile same thing happened to me .
@carlton Pls look into this evaluation.py contains two result Can u confirm that u guys will use 10/20 one ? Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-03-781_com.google.android.apps.docs 1080×2340 253 KB Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-01-349_com.google.android.apps.docs 1080×2340 219 KB
The image shows instructions for counting rows in a database using SQL and `curl`. It outlines steps to start the server, execute a query to save the output to `/data/b10.csv`, and stop the server. An error indicates a failure to read `/data/b10.csv`, leading to a score of 10/20. A final HTTP request shows a successful connection.
The image displays a series of error messages related to a data processing task.  It involves running a datasette server, creating a CSV file, and querying data. The script fails due to an internal server error (HTTP 500), inability to read the CSV file (HTTP 404), and too many requests to the OpenAI API (HTTP 429).  The task also involves installing 'uv' and running a Python script. The final score is 1 out of 20.
HELLO SIR , DOCKET IMAGE PRESENT IN DOCKER HUB  AND IT IS PUBLIC THEN WHY IT IS FAIL image 619×241 5.07 KB image 919×602 28.9 KB @carlton
Project 1's prerequisite evaluation shows mixed results.  While the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are present and public, the Docker image on Dockerhub is not.  This failure causes the overall prerequisites to FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0.
The image shows the details of a repository named "23f2004644/data_automation_agent", with a size of 757 MB. It was last pushed about 1 month ago. The "Tags" section reveals that the repository has one tag: "latest", based on Linux, and of type "Image". The latest tag was pulled 5 days ago and pushed about 1 month ago.

This is a screenshot of a webpage showing a file named "23f2004644/data_automation_agent." It was created approximately a month ago and marked as an "image". The file's visibility is set to "Public" and the status is “Inactive”.
same issue i am also facing , @carlton
Respected Sir, I have received a FAIL status for the prerequisite check: “Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public.” However, as shown in my Docker Hub repository, my Docker images are publicly accessible. I have attached a screenshot for the reference. Thank you for your time and support. Screenshot From 2025-04-01 11-17-44 1866×300 32.5 KB
The image shows the Docker Hub interface, specifically the repositories for the user "santoshsharma003". It displays the user's Docker Personal account with options like "Repositories," "Settings," and "Billing." The list of repositories includes "santoshsharma003/ds-project-one-1," last pushed 2 days ago, contains "IMAGE" and it has Public visibility and inactive Scout status. A "Create a repository" button is available.
Dear team, The evaluation shows that the Github repo was not found, however the repository has published and public. 2025-04-01_13:10:20 564×317 12.3 KB Github URL GitHub - 22f3003029/llm_agent Roll Number: 22f3003029 Request your assistance on the issue. Thank you
The image shows the results of prerequisite evaluations for Project 1. The Docker image being present and public passed. However, the GitHub repo being public, the Dockerfile in the root, and the MIT license also in the root all failed. As a result, the overall prerequisites failed, and the project score is 0.

Respected Team, I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it. Screenshot 2025-04-01 132313 651×276 6.99 KB I checked my Docker Hub and there it is showing “Public” Screenshot 2025-04-01 131944 1479×124 7.78 KB Can Anyone explain what I did wrong ?
The image shows prerequisite evaluations for Project 1, which the submitter failed, resulting in a score of 0. While the GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license passed, the Docker image in Dockerhub failed due to not being present or public. Because of this, the project does not meet the minimum requirements.
The image displays a repository entry named "coolsisters7/llm." It was last updated about a month ago and contains an image. The repository's visibility is set to "Public," and the "Scout" status is "Inactive." The table is organized with columns for Name, Last Pushed, Contains, Visibility, and Scout.
image 593×747 61 KB image 1525×741 52.8 KB Sir, I have the image in the docker and it is upload last month and it is public. So why have I received a message saying that the image is not available in the hub. Can you confirm and reevaluate the error. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand
Project 1 requires prerequisite checks including a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and use the same Dockerfile as in the repository. The learner's project failed because the Docker image wasn't public on Dockerhub, resulting in a failing grade and a score of 0.
The image displays the "Tags" section of the "jayeshbansal/tds_project1" Docker repository. The latest tag, pushed a month ago, is for linux/amd64 architecture with a digest 2bdbd090a678. The compressed size of the tag is 77.02MB. Docker pull command is shown for fetching the image.

Hi @Jayeshbansal , The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. /jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3 docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you. image 1826×222 23 KB
The image is a table showing metadata for a project. It includes a timestamp of 2/16/2025 at 23:55:44, an email address of `24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, a GitHub repository link to `https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/`, and a DockerHub image name of `jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3`.
The log file provided to me too contains File not found error for task A. However, running the code on the evaluate.py files gave me results. Could you please look into the datagen part? @carlton @Jivraj Thanks
It is the request to the team,to consider this since it is a problem of just a case letter otherwise the whole hardwork of doing the project will be wasted. Thank you
Dear instructors, I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and I have been marked fail because the MIT license is not present. But as can be seen in the screenshot below the MIT license file is present in my GitHub repository. Pls look into this matter. Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 2.45.57 PM 1776×1046 91.5 KB
The image shows a GitHub repository named "Project1-TDS." It's public and has one branch (main). The view displays the repository's file structure including folders like `_pycache_`, `app`, and files like `Dockerfile`, `MIT LICENSE`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `requirements.txt`. Recent commits are described such as "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE" and "Initial commit," all made about 2 months ago.

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our code and create a pull request on repo.
