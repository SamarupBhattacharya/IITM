The Python code given in the “Images: Compression” section needs rectification. On reviewing the code below, I saw the following issues: Not using await inside an async function. compress_image(…) is marked ‘async’, even though it doesn’t really do anything asynchronous. If I am not mistaken, PIL operations (like img.convert(…)) are synchronous and blocking. from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import io

async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:
    """Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality."""
    with Image.open(input_path) as img:
        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed
        if img.mode == 'RGBA':
            img = img.convert('RGB')
        # Optimize for web
        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)

# Batch process images
paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')
for p in paths:
    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp')) Removing async and await worked fine for me. Note to Moderators: Kindly keep this active or (in case there is already a similar post) merge it with a related post.
image 1032×213 10.1 KB I think the term “static website” is missing in the definition. It should be: “ GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that turns your GitHub repository directly into a static website whenever you push it.”
The image describes GitHub Pages as a free static hosting service. It explains that GitHub Pages transforms a GitHub repository into a website whenever changes are pushed. It is useful for data science portfolios, analysis results and project documentation.
