Please watch Week 2 session that covered this topic. The video has chapters so you can go exactly to the section you want to understand and see what you might be doing wrong. Kind regards
sorry for asking again sir, i went through the session but i could not find any segment which addresses this issue. when jivraj sir has submitted the link on the portal, it showed correct but for me it is showing error : failed to fetch i dont know the reason why it is the case.
check out last part of session, we discussed what the issue was, and on TDS GA2 official thread it was posted by @bhuvan
