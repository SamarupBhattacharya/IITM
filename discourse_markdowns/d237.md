Thankyou , but now i am getting missing code error. What it means? @23f2000573
You just have to add a space after a hyphen
Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.
No there is no code block in the pdf. Now i m getting missing code error. Why this error can arise @Saransh_Saini
I am also facing the same error in this question
the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries
just change the values as itis coming in the error
change the name manually as the name is diiferent on imdb according to the region, I had the same issue…
are you able do it now? Reload and check
yes facing the same thing
you are missing code block Normal : print(123) Code Block : print(123) you can refer to week 2 q1  for the syntax of code block

The image displays JSON data, which appears to be a list of movies or TV shows. Each entry includes attributes like "title," "year," "rating," and "id." The entries range from older films like "Striptease" (1996) to newer titles from 2023-2024. There is a TypeError at the bottom indicating that some content could not be read properly.

UrbanRide can optimize routing, improve fleet allocation, enhance market analysis, and scale operations by automating bounding box data extraction. The image shows an attempt to input the maximum latitude for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using the Nominatim API, but the input "27.7020999" is flagged as incorrect, with a suggestion to check the OSM ID ending with 8390.

I’m assuming it’s occurring because the text formatting for the JSON is incorrect. Try and put it in the correct format
I’ve reloaded a dozen time and even extracted the data again and again to account for any changes but it still doesn’t work.
