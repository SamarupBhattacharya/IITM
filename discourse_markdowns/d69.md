And sir have the results been updated on Dashboard? Asking because the score’s still 0 on the dashboard.
Subject: Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation Hi Team, I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight. However, I haven’t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0. My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway. Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated? Thank you! @Jivraj @carlton
Can you send us proof that you have submitted the form, I looked at the submissions and could not find your email there.
Your submission was reevaluated, I confirm that in timeframe of 11PM to 2 AM
No They will be updated by today.
I had replied to the email before 11pm with the updated URL as suggested by you in the earlier thread before the form was released. I submitted the form as soon as I saw the message on discourse which was after 11pm.
You used this email address for submitting form kingshubh011@gmail.com Which is not IITM email address, how would we know whom it belongs to?
can you show us what you submitted? Was it a valid url ?
Oh no , i didn’t noticed because the deadline was about to end. But  nothing can be done now? My project is working fine and the score i got in project 1 are also not good so I need the marks to improve my score
Sir! Is it possible that the railway won’t show any of the logs even if the api url is tested?
I don’t know answer to that question, have never used railway, you need to figure out yourself
Sir here is a screenshot of my google form that i submitted

The image displays a Google Form with two questions: the GitHub repository link for "Project 2" and the API endpoint link.  A sample GitHub link format is provided, and example URLs are given for both questions: `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final` and `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/`. The form also includes a question about whether the form looks suspicious.

I am really sorry sir i cant apologise enough but by mistake i used my personal email address instead of the iitm emial snd i deeply apologize for the inconveniences but i request you to kindly consider this project as it is very essential for me to pass this course I will make sure that such silly mistake does not happen in the future but i request you to please Consider this time.

This image shows a Google Form requesting an updated endpoint. The form was created to streamline URL endpoint changes. The user's email (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded upon submission, and users are advised to edit their previous submissions for updates, avoiding multiple entries. An example of an endpoint is shown.
Yes, the new page took about 5–10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter. If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance. In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.
We are not evaluating any wrong submissions.
sir my project 2 is also showing 0 but it was working. pls check if it was not working at least give some marks for the effort that w have put. I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible.
I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions. However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected. I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result. I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed. I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it. To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions. ss 1525×535 24.1 KB
The PowerShell script sends a POST request to a Vercel app asking for the result of a Google Sheets formula.  The formula calculates the sum of the first 10 elements of a sequence generated from 100x100 matrix with the number 15 and 7 repeated The API response, received in JSON format, provides the answer "465" and indicates a "success" status.
