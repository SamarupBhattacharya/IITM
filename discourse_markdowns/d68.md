deploying time the html page on GitHub page that is not in my hand
algsoch.github.io Professional Portfolio | 24f2006438 you can clearly see there is html page publish i think that time my api gave answer with this url
Do you have proof that you have submitted before deadline? Because the gfrom shows the timestamp of being after deadline
Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven’t received the same.
Hi @afsalshah You submitted google form with wrong email address. This was the email address you used for filling form. quizapp.mad2@gmail.com
Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered — I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well. I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.
We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint. Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.
I understand your point, Sir. It was a mistake on my part, but if possible, I kindly request you to consider my submission given the circumstances.
can you send this email which is there in screenshot to me(22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) ? If that proof you can give we will consider reevaluating.
Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini I believe it is a bit late now, but my Programming Quiz score is being displayed as Absent, I remember very well that I got a 4 out of 10, but it has been displaying Absent for a very long time now. This the ROE exam I am talking about here. Kindly fix this issue too.
The image shows results for a student's grades.  "Programming Quiz 1" is marked as "Absent."  The "Course Project" received a score of 35.00, while "Course Project Score 2" received a score of 0.00. It appears to be a snapshot of grades within a course.

Hi Team, Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight , and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API: https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/ However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0 . Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated? Thank you! @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand @Saransh_Saini
The image shows a cartoon-style, light blue chain link against a black background. The link is oriented diagonally, displaying its interconnected, oval shape with simple shading suggesting a metallic or glossy surface.

Dear Sir Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated. Thank you
Hi Team, Please confirm if the evaluations were carried out last night as I don’t see any logs on my api. I had shared my updated ngrok link on email as well as the form shared yesterday. Thank You!
