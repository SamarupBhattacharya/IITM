@23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a “Recent saves” feature. This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these. image 368×152 5.35 KB Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic. Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.
The image displays a "Recent Saves" interface with three save states listed. Each entry includes a "Reload" button, the save date and time, and a score. The most recent save is from 19/1/2025 at 8:17:25 pm with a score of 1.25. The oldest save is from 14/1/2025 with a score of 0.

Screenshot_2025-01-19-19-15-29-055_com.android.chrome 1080×2400 172 KB Sir i might already clicked 3 save todays. So the previous clicks dates are of today. And the same 0 score is showing this.
The screenshot shows a list of questions or tasks, likely for a programming or computer science assessment, due January 26, 2025. The questions cover a variety of topics, including VS Code, HTTP requests, JSON, CSS, GitHub, and file manipulation.  Recent saves indicate previous attempts with a score of 0.
Sha256sum is not recognized as an internal or external command how to solve this plzz answer @carlton
If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum. Here are two disussions that might help you out. Discussion 1 Discussion 2
@Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845 If you are on Windows Powershell Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output. You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed. Kind regards
@s.anand Sir as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out. I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10. Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone? If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks. image 742×336 21.3 KB
The image displays a screen showing "Recent Saves". The top section indicates the current date and time is January 6, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST, with a perfect score of 10/10. Below is a "Reload" option indicating a previous save from January 20, 2025, at 6:05:24 PM, which also has a score of 10.
@iamsarthak – as long as you don’t save again, your score will stay 10, even if I modify the evaluation script We don’t re-evaluate previous results in the graded assignments.
The image depicts a classic smiley face emoji. It features a bright yellow circle with a simple, curved line representing a smile and two oval-shaped, brown eyes. The overall expression conveys happiness, contentment, or a positive sentiment.

@s.anand sir, Question 15 is under the section for linux I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question image 583×167 4.09 KB I can solve this now using pandas. From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?
The image displays a listing of four text files named file0.txt to file3.txt. The listing includes columns for length (in bytes), date, and time. The file sizes vary from 4094 to 9748 bytes, and the dates range from 2000-01-26 to 2010-09-27.
@23f2000573 You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas. But since you already know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like awk (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.
20250120_203950 1920×1440 168 KB Sir is it right of sha sum question
The PowerShell script attempts to navigate to the "Downloads" directory, but encounters an error as the path is not found, likely due to case sensitivity. Subsequently, the script runs "prettier" to format a README file and outputs it. Finally, the SHA256 hash of the generated output file is computed and displayed.
to pass the graded 1 how much points are required for 10 ?
use chatgpt for the solution(sum(take(sortby))), it will give you the wrong answer but explain the concepts, use that go to colab and code one solution(will take abt 2 mins)
I used https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/excel?auth=1
@Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash, 7E…E5 Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt A Hash is a nearly unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation) Kind regards
Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly. I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST. thanks
GA1 Q18. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it. I always get the answer in a nested array. Error: Got [[51006.69]]… I could not use cursor in that shell, to extract the value also. @carlton @Jivraj Please help me with this.
image 1327×464 18.1 KB I am getting error in the uv question. I have got the output json but I cant understand what part do I need to submit in the answer section.
This JSON data represents an HTTP request. It contains "args" with an email, and "headers" that detail the accepted content types, encoding, language, user agent (Mozilla), and other browser-related information. The request originates from IP 45.118.156.154 and targets the URL `https://httpbin.org/get?email=241001769%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
image 1641×356 26.7 KB Sir I’m facing issue in this question even though i have done every thing as it mentioned. Can I get hint of the mistake for my code snippet. My code: - mkdir all_files
find parent/ -type f -exec mv {} all_files/ \;
for file in all_files/*; do
    new_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/[0-9]/\n&\n/g' | awk '
    { 
        if ($0 ~ /^[0-9]$/) print ($0 == "9") ? 0 : $0+1; 
        else print $0 
    }' | tr -d "\n")
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
done
The task involves downloading and extracting a zip file, moving files from subfolders to an empty folder, and renaming files by incrementing digits (9 becomes 0). Then, the user needs to determine the output of a bash command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` ran on the folder's content, and the provided SHA256 hash is incorrect.
Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even,  that didn’t work. Screenshot 2025-01-22 231718 1599×362 19.1 KB Thank You.
The image displays an SQL query intended to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets. The query attempts to sum the product of "Units" and "Price" from the "tickets" table, filtering for rows where "TYPE" is "Gold". It also shows that the output of the query is 42810.5. Additional instructions ask to disregard spacing and misspellings, implying a requirement for more robust string matching.
I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it. Thank you so much. Screenshot 2025-01-22 232338 1621×255 13.9 KB
The image shows a CSS selector challenge. The task is to find all `div` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden HTML element and calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes. An answer box is provided for input, and the response "Incorrect. Try again." indicates a wrong answer.
