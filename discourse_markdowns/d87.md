The image depicts the file directory of "TDS_Project_1/App" in a repository, showing files like 'Dockerfile', 'app.py', and 'readme.md'. The latest commit, authored by RaunakNarwal735, updated the Dockerfile. Most files were last modified a month ago, often involving file uploads. An "Add file" option is available.

image 469×233 8.48 KB linux/amd64 which form should i fill sir?
This image displays information about a software tag labeled "latest." It was last updated approximately one month ago by user "23f2000599".  The digest is "5217284cc507" and is built for the "linux/amd64" operating system and architecture.

Aditya_Naidu: 21f3003062@ds.study.iitm.ac.in , My roll is in x86 list/log , not in ARM list/log. I have written and tested my code on ARM computer. I request to please check my code manually. @Jivraj @carlton . please fill the form for collecting architecture, so that we can rerun evals earlier we relied on docker api to tell us which architecture is being used, but it didn’t classify them correctly.
The image shows the letter "A" in white with a blurry effect. It is set against a solid green background. The letter appears to be slightly translucent due to the blurring.
Hi @23f2000599 check this out Jivraj: Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report

mine is linux/amd64 sir it doesnt come under arm or x86 i think
Hi @23f2002400 Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container. If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.
Hi @23f2000599 amd64 is x86
Ok sir, will fill the form, thank you
One issue file is my app is listening on port 8000. But evaluations being done on 8219 port. so how it will succeed. Please guide what to do.
That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues. Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.
There is a mistake in the url I guess check this out I have a fully functional image which was pushed 1 month ago image 1103×611 55.7 KB Please check this out url:: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pscodes24/dataworks-agent/general
This image displays the "Image Management" section for a Docker image repository named "pscodes24/dataworks-agent". It shows two tagged images with their digests, sizes, operating system/architecture (linux/amd64), last pushed date (about 1 month ago), and last pulled dates. It also provides Docker commands for pushing new tags to the repository.
image 1340×431 9.45 KB This is the correct answer, eval script is not considering newlines properly. @Jivraj @carlton
The image shows a test failure during a data formatting process with the file `/data/format.md`. The expected output was a header followed by a table and a paragraph but the result shows inconsistencies in formatting, including incorrect table alignment and misplaced paragraph. The test case "A2" failed, signaling an error in the formatting logic.
same with me i dont understand how i got 0.
The image shows a yellow circular emoji with a slight smile represented by a curved line. Its eyes are small, dark ovals. A single, large blue teardrop is falling from the side of the emoji's face, indicating mixed emotions.
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 2a8ffa96b140 , but i had never provided this docker image instead my image id is 735a5a477fb2 then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. My docker image was created on linux/amd64. Please, look over it @carlton , @Jivraj . Regards, Atharva Antapurkar 23f1002558
Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068. Additionally, my Docker image ID was d2f27c03b878 , but the ID mentioned in the email was dfac8596cd4c . Please provide clarity on this discrepancy. I have also attached my Docker log file for reference Docker image
I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it. I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2 @carlton @Jivraj
Screenshot (423) 1486×895 43.2 KB Sir so the  user_email isn’t passed while pulling the docker image? Thank you.
The image shows a Python traceback, indicating a `KeyError: 'USER_EMAIL'`.  The error originates in `/app/main.py`, line 22, where the code attempts to access the environment variable `USER_EMAIL` using `os.environ`. The traceback details the call stack through uvicorn and importlib modules, ultimately revealing that the `USER_EMAIL` environment variable is not set.
Hi Team, I have resolved the issues and pushed a new Docker image. New Docker Image ID: 913320f92eb3 Tag: latest OS/ARCH: linux/amd64 Please evaluate my updated submission. Thanks!
Hello, My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether datagen.py was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the /data folder into the container. Could you please clarify this? @carlton @Jivraj
is it like this: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ‘system_input.txt’ ? I am getting this error.
