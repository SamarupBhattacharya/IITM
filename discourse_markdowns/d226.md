Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake image 1108×271 5.87 KB
The image shows a question asking for the markdown content of a PDF formatted with prettier@3.4.2.  A list of text strings, potentially markdown bullet points, is shown, including "cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo", "conservo depereo", "consectetur arx", and "aeternus celebrer."  However, an error message indicates "Missing lists," suggesting an issue with how the list is being parsed or interpreted. The text strings are visually marked with red wavy lines.
this is table. Check it image 313×136 5.2 KB
The image presents a table-like layout with three columns titled "capitulus," "deleniti," and "pariatur."  Each column lists a series of Latin words.  The words appear to be examples of Latin vocabulary, potentially grouped by some thematic or grammatical relationship.

Q 10 - PDF to Markdown. Why it is saying Incorrect. Try again? Do I need to add CSS? Carbo ventosus tametsi patior. Recusandae ciminatio alienus nisi ventosus apud.

I checked many times. For me it says “Incorrect. Try again.”
Ya i know, i added tables, list, blockquote, code, tables have all been added still it’s showing errors. Not sure where am I going wrong.
Please refer video and document relating to Question 1 of Assignment 3. There it is mentioned how to mark bold, table etc., use those marks
I have added all those and pasted the markdown and it appears as above . `` Carbo ventosus tametsi patior.
Recusandae ciminatio alienus nisi ventosus apud.
Theatrum abutor aperio spargo vestrum virga placeat adulescens.
Deripio alveus creator omnis tabula patria cupiditate in virga speculum.
Acidu`s alienus vehemens vapulus. ``

[valde vulgus](;;;) Below is the screenshot of provided PDF. That font colour strains my eyes. Any particular reason for that PDF? image 541×439 20.9 KB
The image displays Latin text, possibly from a lexicon or a practice passage. The text includes phrases, sentences, and individual words like "Carbo ventosus", "curtus careo curatio", and "Cuppedia uberrime". Bulleted points with phrases like "ustulo crudelis depraedor" are listed, and some words appear larger, such as "Cuppedia", highlighting potential topics or themes.
I am getting missing link error. I checked in the pdf file also, the blue color text seems a link but its not clickable. Any suggestion to move nearer to the actual solution.
You may try like this: cresco vomito [cresco vomito](;;;)
Even I’m getting a similar error in Q2, it is expecting a foreign title whereas my search result gives only English titles. image 1614×250 14.4 KB Please help.
The image presents JSON data with keys like "id", "title", "year", and "rating", holding values like "tt8712204", "25. Batwoman", "2019-2022", and "3.6" respectively.  An error message indicates a mismatch in the "title" value. Expected is "13. Pideme lo que quieras", but actual is "13. Ask Me What You Want".
I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate. Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.
A post was merged into an existing topic: Tds: assignment is not submitting
your last saved score (i.e.6 of your’s) will be official score and forgot about seek portal , it is not meant for this type of assignment.
Thank you for the update! I gave Q10 another shot, and I was able to solve it this time. The more liberal checks and improved error messages made a big difference in understanding where I was going wrong. Thank again.
Can we use hacking to get answers to some questions? Has anyone ever done it?

The image describes the impact of automating PDF to Markdown conversion for EduDocs, including enhanced productivity, quality, scalability, and integration. It poses a question regarding the markdown content of a PDF formatted with prettier@3.4.2, followed by some text and the "Error: Missing links". It also states that manual corrections are usually required, implying the difficulty of getting the correct Markdown output from a PDF.
In the pdf you see some blue color font for specific words write that word in format [word](#)
There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf. All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf. Link text Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts, below error is still observed. Error: Missing links Did anyone else face same issue ? Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block. But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone. Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.
Replace actual text to expected text until you got correct
same kind of error is arising with me too.Any suggestion what is wrong with it??
