Sir in my logs it is showing that there’s cv2 module missing i mightve missed adding that in the requirements. Is there anything you could do to help me please?
I am also facing the same issue. I tried evaluating the scripts with the evaluation file also. Please rerun and let me know. My Roll No is 21F1002866.
Hi, For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me. For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK Similarly for task B2. INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request. For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly? Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8
@Jivraj @carlton Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy} This was required  as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup.. So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container  started up without issues.. Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well..  didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help
I am also with the same situation sir. Please help with this issue. I have submitted everything correctly and it was working fine. Thanks
Hello Sir, Greetings, I have not recieved amy mail regarding my Project 1 Marks, can you please look into it. Thank you/
@Jivraj @carlton please sir could you help me with this issue previously when i ran on my system it was working perfectly fine
Hello sir I noticed that the log mentioned: “python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.” However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission? Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!
Even my file saying the same. I got the ‘No module named tasksA’ error whereas at the time of submission it was working perfectly fine. Please kindly look into this issues sir. Thank you.
no taskA.py even though i ran the evalution getting 12 score still no evalution.log help the students please give them second chance
on a side note, to validate and test our docker/podman images on a platform outside of our dev environment we can use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ .. this is a free platform to download run and test docker images …
Hi @carlton @Jivraj I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code? Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this
The docker id of the image that was evaluated (as specified the mail 1ae3f64427f0) is not correct, the correct id is 51168f246618. Name of Docker image - garriimaa/llm_automation:latest Please evaluate with the above image name. GitHub repository for reference - GitHub - Garima1603/llm_automation
@Jivraj @carlton sir I fixed my issue with docker during the given window for discrepancy and requested a re-pulling of the image but still got a mail of score 0. Please sir, I request you to do a re-evaluation, the docker issue is fixed long back by me. It’s an earnest request sir.
Dear sir, @carlton @Jivraj I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve this. 1 885×378 56.1 KB 2 908×579 59.8 KB
Project 1 has prerequisite checks including GitHub repository accessibility, a LICENSE file, a Dockerfile, and correct Docker image configuration.  The evaluation shows the Docker image is present and public, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are failing. The project prerequisites are therefore failed, resulting in a score of 0.
The image shows the file structure of a public GitHub repository named "tds_proj1" on the "main" branch. It lists several files and folders, including Python files like "app.py," "datagen.py," and "evaluate.py," along with "Dockerfile," "LICENSE," and "requirements.txt." Most files were last updated two months ago.
@carlton I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check: “Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?” Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository. Github repo link: GitHub - karthiksirimilla/tds_project1_final My evaluation.log , contains the score 6/20 Roll no : 23f1002398 Mailid: 23f1002398@ds.study.iitm.ac.in My evaluation.log IMG_6418 1290×2619 566 KB
The image shows a debugging log. Errors are occurring when trying to access data files "b9.html" and "b10.csv," resulting in 404 errors. There's also an issue related to connecting to localhost on port 8001, likely during a database task. Finally, a successful POST request to an OpenAI embedding endpoint is shown. The overall score is 6/20.

The email informs a learner about Project 1 prerequisites, including a public GitHub repo with a license and Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image runnable via podman. The learner passed some checks, such as having a public GitHub repo and Docker image, and an MIT license in the repo, but failed to have a Dockerfile in the root, resulting in a failing grade and a score of 0.
@carlton Sir, the image id written in my notification email is wrong. The correct image is this: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/24f1002064/project1/general can you please double check this? You can also verify that I have made no changes to it since the due date.

The email details prerequisites for Project 1, including a public GitHub repo with a LICENSE and Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The evaluation shows that the Docker image, repo, and MIT license passed the checks, but the Dockerfile was not found in the GitHub repository root, resulting in a failing grade of 0.
Your dockerfile is misspelt.
