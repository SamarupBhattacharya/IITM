The error indicates a problem with reading properties and advises contacting the exam team for assistance.
@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone. What happened? I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

The image displays an error message on what appears to be a test-taking platform.  It states "Error! Sorry, we couldn't load the questions," along with a programming error related to undefined properties.  The "Recent saves" section shows no recent saves, and a "Loading questions..." message is present despite the error. It recommends contacting the exam team for assistance.

@s.anand @Jivraj I’m still facing the issue.
i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.
OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts. Kind regards
DOUBT IN -Q 9 Sir @carlton Miranda followed the elusive figure.  In the dim corridor,...................... I listened it ,every words and spellings are matching still this error: Error: Words are too different
Cleaning Data with OpenRefine Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo. However, it says my answer is incorrect. How many units of Bacon were sold in São Paulo on transactions with at least 151 units? city

The image shows a snippet of a spreadsheet with three columns: "city," "product," and "sales." The "product" and "sales" columns have filter icons.  The city listed is consistently "Sao Paulo" with minor spelling variations, while the product is always "Bacon." Sales figures vary for each entry, totaling 2871 in the highlighted cell.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays” Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”? grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_21.44.39_on__14-02-2025__003253 1920×1816 271 KB
The task is to analyze s-anand.net's May 2024 Apache logs, focusing on the "telugu" section. The goal is to determine the number of successful GET requests (status code 200-299) made on Saturdays between May 13th and 23rd, from 13:00 to 23:00 GMT-0500. This analysis informs infrastructure scaling, content strategy, and marketing efforts. The logs have a non-standard space-separated format with specific quoting rules.
Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked- Thank you
I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum. Please consider my request and double check- @Jivraj , @carlton Thank you grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_23.15.25_on__14-02-2025__003255 1920×1317 210 KB

The image displays a pair of emoji-style hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer or supplication. The hands are yellow with blue cuffs. They are centered on a black background. The image is simple and clearly represents a traditional pose associated with prayer, gratitude, or hope.

Any signal for this question? @s.anand @carlton
@23f1003186 thanks again for flagging this. This is fixed, too.
