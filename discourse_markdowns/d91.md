Hi @24ds2000125 You didn’t meet the standard naming convention for mit license naming.  Name should be LICENSE(all caps) or LICENSE.md. check this out. Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Hi @22f3001851 Standard naming convention for Dockerfile name was not followed we won’t be able to evaluate it.

The image shows a checklist for a project, likely related to software development. The project's Docker image is not present or public on Docker Hub. The Github repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are present and public.  However, the prerequisites for the project have not been met, resulting in a project score of 0.
The image shows a table displaying information about two entries, likely repositories or files. Both entries contain images and have public visibility. The first entry was last updated "about 2 hours ago," while the second entry was updated "2 months ago." "Last pushed" is also the title of the table's first column.
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini any updates for the people like me whose image was run on the wrong architecture - mine was ARM ( was evaluated or ×86 ). I filled the form that was later sent for selecting the architecture. I haven’t received any mail since then. But found many mails are sent to others in while.

The image is a snapshot of a GitHub repository named "tds-trail-1" owned by "Mayank8IITM," marked as "Public". The repository's main branch includes Python files (datagen.py, evaluate.py, main.py), a Dockerfile, LICENSE, README.md, and project-related folders. Commits were made 2 months ago, with some related to "Project done 7/10."
Project 1 prerequisite evaluations show the Docker image is present and public. However, the Github repo isn't public, the Dockerfile is missing from the root of the repo, and an MIT license is absent. As a result, the prerequisites are not met, and the Project 1 score is 0.

The task B6 was https://quotes.toscrape.com/ has quotes from famous people. The .author class has the quote author’s name. Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings. E.g. ["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...] The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings. Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors. These are two different things. Almost there but not quite. Kind regards
Hi Course Team, I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true? 1000112508 1080×1716 242 KB
The email informs the learner about their Project 1 prerequisite checks. It lists five requirements involving GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and Docker image. The learner passed the checks for Docker image in Docker Hub, GitHub repo, and MIT license, but failed the Dockerfile check. As a result, the project's prerequisites are marked as "FAIL," and the Project 1 score is 0.
Can someone from TA team reply to this?
can somebody tell me how the dockerfile not running in 5 mins is my fault? i had the same requirements.txt as many other people and their file ran in given time while mine did not. what was the need for this, sorry for my harsh words but i’m frustrated, stupid rule?
For your case there was problem with our script that, we have correct, and your submission have dockerfile, license and repo exisits as well, it will be evaluated.
image 522×190 5.51 KB my dockerfile is available in github, Please look into the issue Thank you
The image shows the prerequisite evaluations for Project 1.  The Docker image being public on Dockerhub and the Github repo being public passed.  The MIT license presence also passed. However, the evaluation failed because the Dockerfile was not present in the root directory of the Github repository.

@Jivraj I also have same issue, can you check this… Repo link 1000431136 1079×2087 175 KB
The image displays a GitHub repository named "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent," maintained by user "lakshay654" on the "main" branch. It includes files like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `task_handler.py`, all updated two months ago. The README highlights creating an API. It uses the MIT license.
@carlton @Jivraj My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues. This situation is particularly disheartening— seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course. I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Kind regards
I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly
dear @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sirs, I have seen that many others have posted similar issues to mine, and you have responded to some of them. To seek your attention, I am replying to this thread. Please consider my request as well, as I do not want to lose marks on a project I have worked hard on, while also helping others. I am expecting a timely and positive response from your end. Thank you.
Dear Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding the results of Project 1. Could you please check if my result was sent or if there’s any update on this? I would really appreciate your confirmation. Mail id - 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
@carlton Respected Sir, I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites. My docker file is available publicly and it is present in the root directory of github repo, still the mail says that the file is missing and my score is zero. Can you please look into this issue image 1145×334 7.28 KB
The image shows a directory listing with Python files (`datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `requirements.txt` file, and a `Dockerfile`. Most files are at version `v1`, except `requirements.txt` which is `v1.1`.  All files were last updated 2 months ago, except for `dockerfile` which was updated by "docker updatae."

Name of your dockerfile doesn’t match the standard’s. It should be Dockerfile (with D caps).
No we are doing another run of evaluations. Results will be sent soon.
dockerfile name should be Dockerfile as this is the standard they are considering .so it was not evaluated you better change that, if they revaluate it will be passed
