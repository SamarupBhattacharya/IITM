Yeah! His issue is genuine. Arnav’s JSON seems to be correct, yet these are some issues faced by him.
Yeah! even I am facing this issue. Despite lot of efforts, last question markdown seems to always incorrect. It is always throwing any sort of error for no reason.
The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to  sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part. I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions @Jivraj @carlton
yes change manually, there are slight changes which we have to do
For the 8th question, i am getting an error that tells me i have not run the action, though i manually triggered it and confirmed the commit was made. Cant figure out whats wrong.
for second query i am getting this result as row 4 and 5 (Screenshot)… but when testing the results it shows {"id":"tt22804850","title":"3. The Sand Castle","year":"2024","rating":"4.7"},
{"id":"tt10128846","title":"4. Megalopolis","year":"2024","rating":"4.8"},
{"id":"tt2322441","title":"5. Fifty Shades of Grey","year":"2015","rating":"4.2"},
{"id":"tt4978420","title":"6. Borderlands","year":"2024","rating":"4.6"}, Error: At [4].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “5. Cinquanta sfumature di grigio”. Actual: “5. Fifty Shades of Grey” image 784×492 91.3 KB
The image displays movie listings, specifically "Megalopolis" and "Fifty Shades of Grey." "Megalopolis" (2024) has a 4.8 rating and a Metascore of 55, set in New Rome. "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015) has a 4.2 rating and a Metascore of 46, depicting Anastasia Steele's life.
image 606×293 20.3 KB sir earlier it was correct and now i submit it again after running my code it shows error.  sir i have done it correct two times earlier. but now again as i click on save button it changed. these tasks are taking too much time and creating more difficulties. please look into this @s.anand @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
The image shows a JSON object representing weather forecasts for Vienna from 2025-02-10 to 2025-02-14. The forecast includes sunny days with a gentle breeze, sunny intervals, light clouds with moderate/gentle breezes. The JSON seems to have an error with "Different number of properties".
image 2100×400 38.1 KB Hi Team , Are we expecting the result to match exactly as per the benchmark of qa4.
The image displays JSON data with a question "What is the JSON data?". The JSON includes the title "1. The Night Agent", year "2023-", and rating "7.5". An error message appears, indicating a mismatch in the title value at index 8; the expected value is related to an invitation but the actual value is "9. You're Cordially Invited".
just edit some of the spellings in answers manually as per errors you get n you are good to go.
22f3002723: Cinquanta sfumature di grigio It is just a translation of the same movie… it’s not different Copy paste the Expected: “title” and click on check It’ll work
The image shows a single, white letter "S" against a muted blue-gray background. The letter is relatively small and positioned in the center of the frame. There's no other discernible detail or context in the image.

@all , in q4 Actually the answer data is sync with current weather description therefore the answer changes. Make sure to update your json file before submitting.
try refreshing the page and re-run the script. as the data gets updated the answer also changes.
refer to the link post, GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science use this Google Colab with the city name to get the Json Body just change the date format. @23f2004752
The image shows a blurry, stylized white letter "V" against a vibrant blue background. The letter has a soft, glowing effect, creating a sense of depth despite its lack of sharp edges. 

i 'm here for the bonus marks, But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this. We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course. And i have never seen any course cool as this, like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side ( and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom , gave client side answer checks’s code to o1 and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this ) keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI. ( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem ) image 1483×687 48.1 KB
The image shows a yellow, circular emoji with a wide, open-mouthed grin. Its eyes are closed in a joyful expression.  A single, large blue sweat droplet hangs above its forehead. This suggests the emoji is expressing a feeling of nervous laughter, relief, or lighthearted embarrassment.

why everytime question 2 answer is showing error in json?
What error are you getting @Abhay222 ? Can you post a screenshot or error details ?
Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal?
@s.anand There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.
getting the same issue Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2024– ". Actual: “2024”
