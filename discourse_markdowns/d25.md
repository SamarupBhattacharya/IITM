image 1296×158 7.29 KB For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next " Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as 2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working
The image describes a task involving file manipulation.  First, you need to download and extract a zip file. Then, use the "mv" command to consolidate all files into one folder, renaming them in the process, specifically incrementing each digit by one. Finally, it poses a question about the output of a series of bash commands.
Hi anant, Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one. In that case 209 would get replaced by 310
Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”
@21f2000370 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer  if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310
Hi Anant, 21f2000370: image 1296×158 7.29 KB Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.
The image features a single, white letter "A" against a teal or turquoise background. The letter appears slightly blurry or out of focus, giving it a soft, diffused appearance. The overall impression is simple and minimalist.

The task is to download and extract "q-move-rename-files.zip". Then, move all files under folders into an empty folder, renaming each file by replacing each digit with the following one. Lastly, it asks what the command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` will show when run in the folder.
In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem? @carlton @Jivraj

The image displays a coding challenge focused on CSS selectors. It asks the user to identify all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden element and then calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes. An input box is provided for the user to enter the calculated sum.
Hi Suhani, npm does not require docker. Kind regards
Hi Hisham, Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

The image shows a web browser displaying a coding assignment about CSS selectors. The user is learning about basic, attribute, and combinator selectors through documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network. They are also given a task to find `<div>` elements with a "foo" class and calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes, with an incorrect attempt of "482" already submitted. Recent downloads are also visible.

Hello Sir. I am unable to install uv in my windows system. Whenever I run the code provided at the reference link in Powershell, my anti-virus system sends a message that it was blocked. Even after blocking Real-time security, uv does not display. What am I doing wrong?

The image shows a standard error message "This site can't be reached," indicating a connection problem. The specific website, "exam.sanand.workers.dev," unexpectedly closed the connection. It suggests troubleshooting steps: checking the connection, proxy/firewall, and running Windows Network Diagnostics. The error code is "ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED." There are "Reload" and "Details" options at the bottom.
Hi manmeet, I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.
Hi samra, Try installing some other browser see if that works.
Hi mishkat, Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.
