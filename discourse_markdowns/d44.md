Hi @adi3 , The .gz file would be sent along with the API request. You can even read the file directly without even downloading it.
The API request would be sent containing the question text and the JSON file/files as a binary stream.
Hi @22f3002933 Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed.
Hi @lakshaygarg654 , Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request. Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.
Thanks for the answer sir. I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well. Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.
Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.
Thanks for your reply @Saransh_Saini I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question. The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s ) Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.
Hi @Saransh_Saini @carlton , In the sample curl command i.e. curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well, But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?
Multiple files can be sent in the API requestion. They would be sent as a list of files.
But in q10 will it be passed as the part of question only??
@carlton in GA 5 q10 the mappings table is sent as part of the question text or any other separate file? @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Query about Week2 Q3 and  Q7 Publishing a page or action takes time to reflect the site or action performed in github. how to solve this timing issue ? Github repo creation and file /action addition completes immediately but publishing of file /action takes time causing the resulting URL to return 404 for a long time before it returns the correct 200 status and content in response.
Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes first.py for GA1. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! Best regards, vicky kumar @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini my model at Vicky kumar tds
In GA5_Q10 the mappings would be sent as either a HTML or Markdown file along with the image. Both files would be send as a List.
@carlton I am bit confused about  answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one  is correct process. 1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my_response as json formatted string) image 726×224 4.68 KB 2nd process ( This one is Json object) image 514×193 3.61 KB or both are incorrect? This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer: image 927×466 20.8 KB This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer: image 984×476 19.7 KB
The Python code imports the `json` library. It defines a string `my_response` as a JSON object containing an "answer" key with the value "26272". The code then uses `json.loads()` to parse the JSON string and extract the value associated with the "answer" key, printing it to the console, which outputs `26272`.

The Python code imports the `json` library, defines a dictionary `my_response` with a key "answer" and value "26272". The `print` statement then accesses the value associated with the "answer" key in the `my_response` dictionary. Consequently, the code outputs the string "26272".
The Python code sends a request to the OpenAI Chat Completions API to analyze sentiment. It defines a function `analyze_sentiment()` which uses the `httpx` library to send a POST request with a system message instructing the model to classify sentiment as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL for a given user-provided text.  The code then tries to execute the function and print the result or any error message. Finally, it prints the value associated with the "answer" key within the loaded JSON data.
The Python code uses the `httpx` library to interact with the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis. It defines a function `analyze_sentiment` that sends a request to the OpenAI API with a system message to analyze the given text. It then attempts to execute it and prints the sentiment or an error message if it fails.
The value of the key "answer" in the dictionary `my_response` is then printed.
@Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj The vercel api question in GA2, does the endpoint that we give you have to be a vercel url or just hosting it in anyway is alright?
@Saransh_Saini the field name “file” would remain same, I mean it won’t be “files” right?
I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID ( 23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in ), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method. @carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure’s student benefits? Screenshot 2025-03-29 145801 1891×451 158 KB
The image shows a Microsoft Azure academic verification page. The user's email domain is not registered, but an alternative verification method is offered. The page instructs users to input name, school country, school name, date of birth, and school-provided email address as per school records for application verification.
Same goes with me also when I try for Academic Verification . @carlton @Jivraj Please look into it .
sir im having the same issue, i have tried so many times. sir azure was asking me to fill in the last name which i didnt register  in my academic records. i have just used my first name while starting this course . can this be a problem while verifying  this azure bcz it says last names field is must to fill in. @carlton @Jivraj sir if the last name was not the issue then pls find us a soln as soon as possible bcz the deadline is in just two days … tds 972×906 12.2 KB
The image shows an academic verification form. It requires fields for first name ("shashikumar"), last name (required), country (India selected), school name ("Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)"), and date of birth. A message indicates that the user's email domain isn't registered, and they can select another verification method.
