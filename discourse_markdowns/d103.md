Dear @carlton This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the /app/app/main.py file is missing. However, in my project directory, the main.py file is located in the app/ folder, and the run.py file is in the root folder of the project, which is LLM_Automation_Agent . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py . To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py . I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder ( llm-automation-agent ). For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot. Here is the GitHub link to my project: github.com GitHub - ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent Contribute to ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent development by creating an account on GitHub. image 1440×2823 252 KB Lookig forward towards your support.

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received. The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb. Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated. Thankyou @carlton

My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...]) , which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx , this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected. For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.
@Jivraj @carlton Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required. But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown. Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine? image 1591×712 123 KB Screenshot 2025-04-07 192419 1534×760 38 KB

Can you tell me what application is this (FastAPI) one ?
idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb. image 1670×914 67.9 KB image 1376×935 60.5 KB

Dear Sirs, @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended. Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513 805×197 9.52 KB Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent . Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter. Thank You and Regards, 24ds3000090

@carlton @Jivraj Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10. image 1298×857 29.4 KB I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow. Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. image 1027×510 11 KB Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well. Thank you. Regards, Shivaditya

Hi Haricharan Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured. This is the error when building it: => ERROR [8/8] COPY .env /app/                                                                                                                         0.0s

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.
Respected Sir, Yes Sir, I said the same, .env was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded when we download the repository it doesn’t have the .env file, for docker image to build we need to add .env with AIPROXY_TOKEN after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message As you said Sir that you will use separate AIPROXY_TOKEN …you can put that in .env file and build the docker image after that Sir its optional to pass AIPROXY_TOKEN again while running the docker Image just the .env file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used: git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git adding .env with AIPROXY token and replacing evaluate.py and datagen.py with new ones according to test environment docker build -t llm-agent . docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent and in another terminal uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Thank you Kind regards
