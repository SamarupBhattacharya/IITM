there is no automatic appending. We will test exactly what we sent in the email (if you got an email) which is exactly what you submitted .
we will consider the greater of the two
need to include the /api in the end. without that your mark will be 0 , since it cannot be evaluated without an end point
You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).
sir i am using ngrok. Shall i edit the old url in the form with the new one ? will you consider the new url in the form?
If u restart ngrok it changes endpoint every time. Your old endpoint is non existent as far as i know.
yeah thats why asking.
Is the marks shown on dashboard out of 20 or 100? coz i can clearly see in the logs that my api has answered all questions correctly, and my dashboard shows score of 20 for project 2.
I also want to know the same thing. Our old ngrok endpoint is useless at this point.
marks are always out of 100 on dashboard
@carlton sir i am using ngrok. Shall i edit the old url in the form with the new one ? will you consider the new url in the form?
I’m writing to clarify the status of my  Project 2, which is currently marked as “Absent”. I would like to respectfully state that I submitted the form before the deadline — specifically on  31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the  response copy as proof. I would also like to emphasize that: No edits were made to the form after submission. I  did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline. My  Vercel API is still active  and functioning as expected. Here are the submitted links: GitHub Repo: GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver API Endpoint: https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/ I kindly request you to review my submission  and take the necessary steps to update the status. image 1897×546 29.5 KB image 1533×736 42.8 KB image 1905×953 32.7 KB
The image presents a digital illustration of a single chain link. The link appears to be made of a light blue, possibly metallic material, with a slight sheen suggesting a smooth surface. The background is solid black, isolating the link as the central focus.

The image shows a stylized, light blue link icon against a black background. The link is composed of two interlocked oval shapes, creating a visual representation of connection or association. It's a simple, digital illustration, likely used as a symbol for hyperlinks or related concepts.

This image shows a Gmail email receipt from Google Forms for "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025," sent on March 31, 2025, at 22:11. The email confirms the form submission and includes an "Edit response" button, suggesting the user can modify their submitted data.
The image shows a Google Form asking for the link to a GitHub repository for Project 2 and the link to its API endpoint. The GitHub link provided is "https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2" and the API endpoint link is "https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/". The form also includes a link to create your own Google Form and a "Report" option for suspicious forms.
The image shows a web form with the title "Submit Your Question." It contains a text area for entering a question and an optional file upload field for ZIP files. A "Submit" button is placed below to submit the form. The website is hosted on Vercel.
You used your personal email address while filling the form. It is impossible for us to track who is submitting a form if you do not use your official email id. Unfortunately we cannot evaluate your submission.
@carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini Sir, Earlier I received an email stating I need to turn on my server again , but I am afraid that I will not be able to do so as I have already travelling and will be travelling till 18th. I am sure you will understand my situation and therefore requesting to please help/suggest on way forward. Thanking in advance for your valuable help and support. Kind Regards, Anushka Kumar (22f2000559)
Sir i have not received any email regarding this please look into my url project2final-beta.vercel.app TDS Solver Sorry to keep bothering you again and again but it is very important for me that my project 2 scores are up to the mark to pass kn the end term
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir i am sorry that i keep resending this same message but please clarify this alone sir. image 1596×531 53.3 KB the mail i got mentions that no other endpoint will be tested and it is showing the old ngrok link. now if i edit the form and change the url will you consider the new one? please clarify sir…
Due to a low score, learners are requested to turn on their server endpoint from 11 PM to 2 AM for a P2 Evaluation rerun. Testing will occur only on endpoints submitted via official forms, not discourse or email. The endpoint to be tested is provided in the email.
Sir this is my repository and link for my api please look into it 1080×2400 196 KB
The image shows a Google Form asking for two links: the GitHub repository link for Project 2, exemplified by "https://github.com/username/repository-name", and the API endpoint link for a POST request. An example repository link "https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final" and API link "https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/" is provided. It also asks if the form looks suspicious.

we are discussing it with operations. as soon as we know we will inform you.
I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the  valid, timely submission and the active working links provided. This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant  setback, potentially requiring me to  repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Respected Carlton Sir, I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url: tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app TDS Solver but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL
