Please post any discrepancies related to project1. @carlton Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate? All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 . Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Bug fixes If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros. Kind regards, TDS Team
What is the highest mark anyone has scored? Is it 22/20 @Carlton ?
How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12?
@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated. We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.
You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.
I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM . This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error . This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389
We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.
Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.

I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error and Evaluation log file is MISSING. Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started. I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine. Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.51.59 AM 1613×182 19.1 KB Even just now I tried running the exact image: Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.53.35 AM 1220×169 25.8 KB It is running fine on my macbook air m1 (ARM) @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
The image shows a single, capital letter "D" in white. It appears to be a simple, clean font against a solid gray background. The letter has a subtle shadow effect, giving it a slight depth or three-dimensional appearance.

The image shows details of a Docker image tagged "latest", pushed a month ago by "pradeepmondal."  The "docker pull" command is displayed for easy copy.  The image's digest is listed, and it runs on Linux/arm64/v8.  It was last pulled a day ago, and its compressed size is 179.2 MB.
The image shows the output of a `podman run` command, executing a container with the image `047fa151bf43`. The container is configured with an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and port mapping 8000:8000.  The logs indicate that the server started, the application startup was completed, and Uvicorn is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
22f2001389: uploaded Facing the same issue sir, kindly look into it. I had made sure all the files including the docker file were working perfectly fine. Please help me out. Roll no. 23f1002056
The image shows the capital letter "R" in white, with a subtle glowing or blurred effect around the edges. The background is a solid, deep pink or magenta color. The "R" appears centered and is the main focus of the image.

My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly. I request for re evaluation of my project. my roll no is 22f1000703
Respected, I haven’t received any mail yet regarding the TDS Project 1 marks. Please look into it. Regards, Soham
My evaluation log file is missing. The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed. the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL, What was evaluated? How it was evaluated? This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07 My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids. tds-project-1              latest    c854274f078d   5 weeks ago    1.38GB ayush6871/fastapi-agent    latest    27e8375b0ab1   6 weeks ago    1.66GB I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake somewhere. 21f3001194
I have also built the image on Mac and facing the same issue exec format error It is running fine on my Macbook Pro M1 @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
Sir I have noticed a technical glitch for the docker issue, wherein I mistakenly uploaded the wrong docker image link so kindly please kindly re evaluate it.
Sir I haven’t received any mail regarding this Project1 marks. @Jivraj @carlton
@carlton Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042  , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. Please, look over it. Regards, Harsh Jaiswal 23f1001995
