@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, The SQL is syntactically correct and in executable format as evidenced by its successful execution and acceptance by the evaluation script of the Graded Assignment. image 690×376 15.7 KB The error appears to stem from the way the Project 2 evaluation script handles escape characters such as newline ( \n ). This inconsistency has resulted in a correct answer being marked as incorrect, despite the fact that the same query was previously accepted by the evaluation script of Graded Assignment without any issue. Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students. I respectfully request that you review this matter and ensure that the evaluation criteria are consistent across the evaluation scripts. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process. I kindly request that you reconsider my submission and award the marks that are rightfully due.

The image shows a SQLite database table named "tickets" with columns 'type', 'units', and 'price'. The task is to calculate the total sales for tickets of type "Gold". The SQL query provided correctly uses `SUM(units * price)` and `WHERE TRIM(LOWER(type)) = 'gold'` to achieve this, ignoring case and spaces in the ticket type.
Hi Premdeep, We will update your score to consider \n for SQL query. I had briefly read your post and incorrectly assumed that the script was not handling newline characters (which are invisible whitespaces). The prescription given by Anand in a live session exclusively conducted by him was clear. We should be able to copy paste your answer from the JSON response and put it in the GA and it should work. There only some notable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This question does not require formatted text, but it does require handling of quotes. Your response has literal a \ and literal n characters. It fails the copy paste test. If it had the invisible actual new line characters encoded then it would be parsed correctly. In your own image that you shared you did not copy paste the return response of your function into your GA. I also looked at your repo and the mistake you made for this question was you used a multiline string for the SQL query. The result of the json.dumps for this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \n that we do not parse. We are only parsing for quotes which our script does handle. As a result, I would like to reiterate, your return fails the copy paste test. Therefore we will not be able to award you marks for this. There are many students who got this correct. I suggest you to check out some of their repos to see why they were able to get the right answer. Kind regards TDS Team
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, The required tag, <!--email_off--> , is indeed present in my deployed site at https://23f1001231.github.io/testsite/ , as can be verified directly. Furthermore, this exact implementation was previously evaluated successfully and accepted as correct by the evaluation script for Graded Assignment 2, demonstrating its validity. Github repo link : https://23f1001231.github.io/testsite/ image 1094×298 61.6 KB image 1056×355 37.1 KB image 928×161 11.5 KB Video proof below shows my solution as correct and valid by the evaluation script of the Graded Assignment. The error in Project 2 appears to arise from the evaluation script’s handling of the tag—specifically, its use of a regex that fails to detect <!--email_off--> when it follows an <a> element. This is a technical flaw in the evaluation process, not an issue with my solution. The inconsistency between the evaluation scripts for the Graded Assignment and Project 2 has resulted in a correct answer being unfairly marked as incorrect. Such ambiguity in automated evaluation is deeply concerning and leads to confusion and unwarranted penalization of students. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the submitted solution, is unjust. If this issue remains unresolved, it will negatively and unfairly impact my overall course grade, despite my submission being fully correct and in line with assignment requirements. This outcome, caused by factors outside my control, undermines the integrity and fairness of the evaluation process. I respectfully request that you review my discrepancy issue in light of these facts and ensure that evaluation criteria are applied consistently. I kindly request you to reconsider my solution and award the marks that are rightfully due. Thank you for your attention and understanding.

@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Sir I wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission. My project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn’t use http or https in the URL—it’s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I’d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding. With due respect, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it’s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We’ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python—so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn’t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility—I’m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern. I don’t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That’s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I’ve been told!). To be honest, I initially thought TDS would be easier compared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I’ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects—except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an ‘E’ grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I’d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again—which isn’t covered under the CSR fund. So, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project’s score. Updating the script shouldn’t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily. I’m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment—just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort. Please consider this message as a humble and respectful request—I’m just exercising my right to politely express a concern.
We have made the update to your score and awarded you 4 marks (out of 20) for your endpoint. Kind regards
@carlton So, marks will be awarded for both the questions I mentioned?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Please response. Efficient communication is very important in this type of course.
You already got an A and more marks will not change the grade. You have received an increase in your P2 score and that is reflected in your t score.
Sir can you please check my post URGENT wrong score on dashboard - #2 i got 70 in my mail for official score and now it shows 54 in my dashboard i have no clue whats going on
@carlton Please reply me on this post URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 - #4
The course team and operations have consulted on this. We will not be able to make an allowance for this request because the rule was applied uniformly for everyone. Kind regards
@jkmadathil Kindly ask developer to look into this. Thanks PS. There seems to be portal error that has nothing to do with the course team, Operations has been notified that there is a glitch on their front end that is showing the wrong grades and scores. Please wait for them to fix it.
I just wanted to request a re-evaluation of my project. I got 0 marks, but my deployed project is working fine and meets all the prerequisites mentioned. I had updated the domain using the API and submitted the correct link through the Google Form, but I think it was evaluated using the old domain. Also, one of my friends got 80 without HTTPS, so I’m a bit confused about the criteria. I’m not asking for an S or A grade—just a fair evaluation. I’ve put in a lot of effort and really don’t want to pay the fee again to repeat the course, especially since I already got 0 in P1. I hope you can please take another look.
Can we expect an update by today? @carlton
sir i have mention issue i got but no update on this report (1)_page-0001 1242×1755 215 KB report (1)_page-0002 1242×1755 179 KB report (1)_page-0003 1242×1755 185 KB
The image shows two failed test cases from an API. Case 1 involves failing to find a hidden email in an HTML, while Case 2 concerns retrieving a Hacker News post with "text editor," returning an unrelated 2FA app post instead. The expected and actual results differ in both cases, indicating errors in the API's output.
The image describes a bug report or technical issue related to JSON parsing. It concerns "Case 3: JSON Key Count - XF Parameter." A script was intended to parse a nested JSON file, count occurrences of a specific key "XF", but it resulted in a "Invalid JSON" error, suggesting a problem with the input JSON file, `E:\data science tool\GAS\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json`.
The user utilized a cURL command to parse a nested JSON file and count the key "XF". The API response indicated 14,602 occurrences of "XF", matching the user's logic. However, the API threw a parsing error despite the JSON file being valid, potentially due to incorrect handling or decoding on the API side.  The user's solution is considered 100% correct for the initial, straightforward "XF" counting task.

Kind regards TDS Team [carlton]     ( https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/carlton )Regular 22h We have made the update to your score and awarded you 4 marks (out of 20) for your endpoint. Kind regards According to the official dashboard, there has been no increase reflected in my Project 2 score, which remains at 20 out of 100. This is inconsistent with your claim that my score has already been updated. I have previously submitted a formal discrepancy form for two questions that were incorrectly evaluated by the Project 2 evaluation script. Furthermore, @carlton has explicitly confirmed that the marks for these questions would be updated. To date, this correction has not been implemented and my score hasn’t updated. The marks in question are not trivial. If the corrections are made as promised, my overall course percentage will increase by a minimum of 6%. This is a substantial change that directly affects my academic record. The assertion that “more marks will not change the grade” overlooks the broader implications of accurate and fair assessment. It is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process. I respectfully request that you to update my Project 2 score to accurately reflect the corrections as confirmed by @carlton , provide a clear clarification of my revised Project 2 score (out of 100) and ensure that my overall course percentage is recalculated accordingly.

Hello Sir, I kindly request reevaluation for project 2 as its still showing 0 and I don’t see any logs in my endpoint Also for assignment 1 grades tab( below modules tab) is showing 100 by on dashboard its reflecting 65 . Sir please have a look.
@carlton Project 2 marks update Sir I am a degree potential student and i got 35 marks with U grade in TDS. My project 2 marks are not added. The reason is one of my mistake that i misunderstood that we have to provide browser link for the project 2 instead of api one. I am aware of two mails from  TDS team side to update the url but my browser link was working perfectly so did not updated it and when results came it said that 405 errror. and i got 0 marks. I am giving the correct api link here : https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/ Please sir help me about it. I am a degree potential student and  i will have to take TDS only in my next term. Please help me sir i just need 5 marks. Please reevaluate me Sir. One more thing is that when i tried to send post request using powershell, curl was not working so i had to use something else. like … Define the endpoint and the question $uri = “ https://tdssolver-7s6meq5el-akbar-alis-projects-e047c36e.vercel.app/api/ ” $questionText = “What is 17 multiplied by 8?” Create the content body as form-urlencoded $body = @{ question = $questionText } Send the POST request $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” Show the result $response image 1062×415 22.4 KB
The image shows a PowerShell script designed to query the Hacker News RSS API.  It defines an API endpoint and a question about a post mentioning "Minimalism" with at least 38 points. The script then constructs a POST request to the API with the question, retrieves the response, and extracts the relevant link, displaying it as the "answer": `https://insideevs.com/news/693231/tesla-model-x-owner-has-had-enough-minimalism-adds-physical-buttons/`.
