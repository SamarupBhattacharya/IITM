Hi @23f1001524 This was a problem from our end, we have recitified it your submission was valid.
Your latest score through pulling from github and building image thorugh dockerfile have higher score than these 2.
Hi @23f2004563 I checked we have scores against your submission.
There was some problem with our script, later we correct and your submission was valid, I have just checked and confirm you.
Can u pls share marks :') dying with curiosity
image 1841×248 24.4 KB This was your submission and we could not locate a docker repo against it. image 1885×918 92 KB
The image shows data in a table format. The first row lists headers: Timestamp, Email Address, GitHub repository link, and DockerHub image name. The data shows an email address "23f1000057@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a GitHub repository link "https://github.com/Vedant22042004/project" and the DockerHub image name "vedant22042004/project", associated with the timestamp "2/16/2025 20:39:53".
The image shows a 404 error on Docker Hub. The URL indicates the user was attempting to access tags for a project under the username "vedant2204". The error message states "Oops! The page you have requested was not found," suggesting the project or its tags do not exist or are not accessible.
Your submission was valid there was some issues with our script for checking. But after building your image after pulling github repo, it didn’t one taskA module was missing.
If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code. API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.
mail will be sent by either today or tomorrow.
any idea on this sir?..
No we pulled through github and build image on gcloud vm. Anyone with valid submission didn’t receive mail, your submission was valid.
but my evaluation log file was missing… so that would make it a 0 right..I have accepted my fate that it would be a 0 but just a lil hope
The image depicts a melting face emoji. It's yellow, with small, oval eyes and a simple curved smile. The lower portion of the face appears to be dripping or dissolving, giving it a melting effect. The overall impression is one of feeling overwhelmed or melting down.

We reevaluated and found your submission was valid but it was running on a different port, 5000 but it was expected to run on 8000 port.
oh so… is it going to be considered? like will i get some score other than a 0… am sorry for asking so much
No it won’t be considered. It was supposed to be running on 8000 port.
Ok got it. Thank you so much
The image displays a yellow emoji face with a sad expression. It features downcast eyes, furrowed eyebrows, and a slightly downturned mouth. A single, large blue teardrop falls from one eye, conveying feelings of sadness, disappointment, or grief.

image 1867×787 43.8 KB Hi sir, my Architecture says amd64, in the google docs I have selected x86, i hope it is correct. Also,  I have used podman to test the pull and its working well. Please let me know if i need to do anything else. @carlton
The image displays the "zakiy7/my-fastapi-app" repository, managed by zakiy7 and last updated a month ago. The "Tags" tab is selected, showing the "latest" tag. The digest, OS/ARCH (Linux/amd64), last pull date (5 days), and compressed size (261.49 MB) are provided, along with a command to pull the Docker image.

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo. That way there is no architecture issues. Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this  check. So dont worry.
I just checked from my side also, wow a very dumb mistake now costing me a 0…should have read the project document more clearly So sorry for asking. Am assuming no lenient correction can be done for that? like during the evaluation … podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:5000 $IMAGE_NAME
The image displays a bright yellow emoji face. The face has sad, downturned eyebrows and a slightly frowning mouth, conveying a general sense of unhappiness or disappointment. A single blue teardrop streams down the left cheek, emphasizing the feeling of sadness or mild grief.

Screenshot 2025-04-03 160336 1373×928 80.4 KB I checked it multiple times before submitting, I got 9/10 in task A.
The image shows the file structure of a GitHub repository named "llm-automation-agent" under the username "23f1002643". It contains files like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`, and a `_pycache_` folder. Most files were added two months ago, with a total of 4 commits.
