Good idea @23f2005138 and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads: [
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" }, … with the year and ratings quoted.
lakshaygarg654: In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given. For the particular instance - “2024–” , it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.
Here's a summary of the image:

The image shows a man wearing a white shirt and a black blazer. He appears to be of Asian descent and has short dark hair. His expression is neutral, and he is looking directly at the camera. The background is a simple, slightly blurred white.

Thanks @21f2000709 for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.
GA 4 Q2 My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ? image 501×151 37.6 KB image 1226×258 13.2 KB contradiction : " 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON) " 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement ) Regards GOVADHANAN N
The image shows information for the movie "Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" released in 2023, with a runtime of 1 hour and 24 minutes. It is listed as "Not Rated" and has a user rating of 2.9 based on 33,000 ratings. The film also has a Metascore of 16.
The image shows a question about JSON data with an example containing movie title, year, and rating. An error message indicates a mismatch in movie titles. The expected title "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" differs from the actual title "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey".

so just exchange it.
Thanks for your response. Many such titles have contradiction from what is expected and what is there in the website. This case the samples are 25 your approach is accepted to some extent, but on a larger sample space, need to work it right !
thanks for this, was wondering why it wasn’t working!
question4 692×539 36.3 KB sir,  we are getting this error. My  Actual output is after get request on the given api i get only one day forcast data. I have show in above image
The image displays a JSON weather forecast example, showing weather conditions for specific dates in "2025-01". It then poses a question asking for the JSON weather forecast description for Kuala Lumpur, with a given answer and an error message noting different number of properties. The error indicates a structural mismatch in the JSON format compared to expected schema.
yes replace manually until you got correct ans . Error will suggest you what to change.
{ “2025-02-08”: “Light snow and light winds”, “2025-02-09”: “Light snow and light winds”, “2025-02-10”: “Light cloud and light winds”, “2025-02-11”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-12”: “Sunny and light winds”, “2025-02-13”: “Sunny and light winds”, “2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-16”: “Sleet and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-17”: “Light rain and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-18”: “Light rain showers and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-19”: “Drizzle and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-20”: “Light rain and light winds”, “2025-02-21”: “Light rain and light winds” } i got this after running my python script for question 4 but, got Error: At root: Property name mismatch" this error message
@s.anand sir, I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so. image 1005×250 15.4 KB
The image shows a JSON-like data structure representing movie information, including "id," "title," "year," and "rating" for "11. Kraven the Hunter."  An error message indicates a mismatch in the "title" field, specifically that the expected value ("11. Kraven: The Hunter") does not match the actual value ("11. Kraven the Hunter").
For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.
here is the difference of  ‘:’ in the expected ans. so make it manually correct . i did the same and got correct ans . and in the question also it is mentioned that may be manually you need to correct.  just give a try.
run your console script again and match the description.
yes, same happened with me . correct it manually.
In q10 links are not accessible through pdf and also creating problems while converting to markdown
image 1358×1151 179 KB Why question 4 starts failing. It was working correct yesterday. Because of it I am getting 9/10 marks.
AgroTech Insights aims to automate weather data extraction for farmers using the BBC Weather API. The task involves retrieving Manila's weather forecast, extracting the `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`, and creating a JSON object mapping each date to its corresponding description. An example JSON format is provided. A code section shows the expected output for a Manila JSON weather forecast.
The result is dynamic with changes made in the API. So try re-executing your code today and it will automatically solve. Your code is right ! Just make a re-run and things will work out
The image shows a simple, yellow smiley face emoji. It has two round, dark brown eyes and a gentle, curved smile. The face is round and smooth, creating a friendly and positive expression.

try running the console again and it will work, make sure the data matches with the one in api as it changes regularly
Thanks!. It is working now. I had to manually correct 5 movie titles to get it correct.
