Hello, I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still? @carlton @Jivraj image 1340×527 17.9 KB image 1002×560 51.4 KB
The image shows a webpage interface, likely related to an educational platform, indicating that it ended on Jan 26, 2025. The user is logged in with a specific student ID. There is a link to a discussion forum. Recent save data includes reload options with associated timestamps and scores (ranging from 8.5 to 10).
This screenshot shows a graded assignment that is past due. It provides troubleshooting tips for access issues, emphasizing the use of the student ID for evaluation. The user incorrectly answered "No" to seeing the assignment, resulting in a score of 0, with the correct answer being "Yes".
@Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. Kind regards
Dear Sir, I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?
sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please

Hello, I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.
Respected Sir, I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time? Thanks
@23f2005471 Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards
Respected Sir/Madam, I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this image 1463×795 64.3 KB

Dear @s.anand sir, For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time?? I will make sure I submit it in both places next time. I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course. I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission image 747×473 15 KB

The screenshot shows an online assignment with a deadline of January 26, 2025. Instructions permit using any resource, including hacking. It advises trying TDS if the assignment takes under two hours and offers the potential for a high grade with effort. The user, logged in with an IITM email, has multiple recent saves with a score of 9.5. There is also a discourse link for help.
hi even i have faced the same issue
@Jivraj @carlton I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation. image 856×693 86.9 KB
The image shows a student's online assignment attempt.  The student achieved scores of 9, 8.5, and 8 in previous attempts. They are now asking for their submission to be evaluated because they forgot to click "yes" to a question confirming they saw the graded assignment and attempted it, despite having saved their score. The current score is 0 and the correct answer should be Yes.
@Thinesh @23f1002223 @22f3001365 @Anshuman_Dave Graded assignment 1 - Submission not shown Tools in Data Science @Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. 
You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. 
Kind regards Please refer to this post. Kind regards

The image displays an online quiz or assessment interface. It shows the quiz has ended on January 26, 2025, with a current score of 0. There's a "Recent saves" section displaying past attempts. Below, a list of 18 questions covers topics like VS Code, HTTP requests, Google Sheets, JSON, CSS, GitHub, and SQL, each with assigned marks.
Hi Mandy, Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released). Kind regards
I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard. GA1 1519×799 75.2 KB
The image shows a correctly answered SQL query on an online exam. The task was to retrieve rows from the 'tickets' table where the 'type' is 'Gold', while ignoring case and extra spaces. The query uses `LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold'` to achieve this. The exam is due on January 26, 2025, and the current score is 10/10. The submission has already been completed, and the prompt reminds the user to save regularly.
