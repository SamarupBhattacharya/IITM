It can be GOLD,gold, or even GoLD. "  Get all rows where the Type is “Gold”. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as “Gold”. Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.  "
Try to go through the given video of css selector and go through all foo classes carefully(using inspect) and sum them up!
Try to remove the White spaces in your code!

The image displays a coding challenge about listing file attributes and sizes. A script is used to list files, their sizes, and modification dates. The challenge asks for the total size of files larger than 1235 bytes and modified on/after Nov 6, 2019, 10:48 AM. The entered answer is incorrect.

In GA1, Question no: 9. when i sort the json it says incorrect. but i validated that json using validator and also manually admin : could you pls validate my answer pls
You need to submit whole json becausae In this image headers is part of response, not request headers.
Hi Arnav, I tried your script on your dataset. Problem might be you are not executing grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in correct directory, you would need to execute it from all_files directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.
22f2001175: Untitled design 1414×2000 349 KB Untitled design1414×2000 349 KB Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested. kind regards
The image shows a capital letter "L" in white with a subtle, blurred shadow effect, giving it a slightly raised appearance. It's set against a solid, muted blue background, creating a simple, clean, and modern aesthetic.

The image shows a PowerShell script used to filter files based on size and modification date.  The script lists files and their attributes, filtering for those larger than 1235 bytes and modified on or after November 6, 2019, at 10:48 AM.  The user attempted to input the total file size, but the submitted answer was incorrect.
Hi Saravanan, I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name Bob , but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset. We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution. kind regards
Thanks lot jivraj. i updated my script and answers too Thanks

The image displays a "JSON Hash" with seemingly random key-value pairs in a text input. A "Hash" button sits below the input. An error message appears at the bottom stating, "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)", suggesting the provided JSON is malformed.

The image is a programming tutorial about AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot, which use LLMs to enhance coding. It instructs the user to run Visual Studio Code, type `code -s` in the terminal, and input the output. The response is marked as "Incorrect. Try again." suggesting a test of understanding.

The image describes a task: download and unzip a file, replace "IITM" with "IIT Madras" in all files within, preserving line endings. It then asks what the output of `cat * | sha256sum` would be in bash in the modified folder. The provided SHA256 checksum is incorrect, prompting "Incorrect. Try again."

The image shows an example of using the 'uv' package/project manager in Python. It demonstrates installing the 'httpie' package, sending an HTTPS request to a URL with a URL-encoded email parameter, and prompts the user to provide the JSON output of the command, but the user's attempt results in a syntax error related to incorrect JSON formatting.
first convert in into jason using bash or other terminal then paste the converted json content to this page and generate the json hash
I am getting errors for the host part please guide me
But I have converted the file as it says in the question still i am getting error that I am unable to understand. Can you just tell me please what formatted answer should be that is just the type of answer it’s asking?
I tried this. For me still the answer is incorrect. image 1677×358 22.2 KB
The image shows a terminal session where a user navigates to their downloads directory and calculates the SHA256 hash of a file named `README.md` using `certutil`.  Then, they format the `README.md` file using `prettier` and save it to `output.txt`. Finally, they use `Get-FileHash` to calculate and display the SHA256 hash of `output.txt`, along with the file path.
Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.
The image shows a terminal command execution. The user "sarva" on the machine "SURIYA" in the "downloads" directory is using npx to run prettier version 3.4.2 on the README.md file. The output of prettier is piped to the sha256sum command to calculate the SHA256 hash of the formatted file, which is displayed below.
I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer. // Select all and elements with the ‘foo’ class const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”); // Initialize a variable to store the sum let sum = 0; // Iterate through the selected elements fooElements.forEach(element => { // Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”)); // Add the value to the sum if (!isNaN(value)) { sum += value; } }); console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);
