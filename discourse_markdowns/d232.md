Best way to solve Q2 is , look at the network tab in dev tools and get the url used for assessment and get data from it .
u have used a apace (_) after 2.9  which is not visible at front that’s why it is throwing error , it should be just (“2.9”) not ("2.9 ")
Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14  pairs.
Screenshot (7) 1366×768 243 KB Open the BBC Weather website. Press Ctrl + Shift + I . Select the ‘Network’ menu. Select ‘Fetch/XHR’. Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. Do not press Enter while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear. ‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu. Double-click it to open a web page ( https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key} ). This will give the API. Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.
The image shows a BBC weather webpage displaying forecasts for cities worldwide. Karachi, Pakistan has been searched. The Chrome DevTools "Network" panel reveals the "locationTaki" API call fetching location data, with a 200 status code, initiated by "search.js2", taking 2.31 seconds. It indicates the network activity associated with loading weather data for locations on the BBC website.

#question 10 Hi, Can anyone help me with Question 10? No matter how i try to post the markdown, it is always showing that either the words are missing or are different from the original. I have tried every possible way i could think of but it is not working.
Getting this question right is a tough nut to crack…so I would rather suggest you to do using the developer tools by inspecting the source code and  putting the breakpoint followed by writing the code in the console to retrieve the expected answer

This implies a validation issue related to the repository's latest activity and user identification.
Hi Team, I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter conditions, image 1640×302 20.4 KB I took first 25 films which 5 to 6 rating, but json seems to be different. Could anyone please tell me what i did wrong here?
The image shows JSON data including a movie's year (2024), rating (6.0), and IMDb ID (tt30292390). An error is reported due to a title mismatch, where the expected title "11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg" doesn't match the actual title "11. The Calendar Killer". A note indicates that IMDb search results can vary regionally and may require manual translation.
Solved the above issue, please ignore it.
Believe it or not, I solved it image 657×516 26.1 KB
The image shows a question asking for the markdown content of a PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2.  The provided markdown includes pipe-separated text like "|adficio|chirographum|" and "|---|---|", followed by phrases. The answer is marked as correct, with a note that Markdown extraction from PDFs is hard and requires manual correction. The question only checks basic things.

In the 10th question, how do we add headings and links to the markdown output?(getting error: Headings missing)
first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system. but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.
this is a changing dataset so make changes to your answer accordingly and you will get it correct
Do the necessary changes as it is said below as it is an everchanging dataset. You will get the answer correct once you make the changes asked after checking.
check you code and do the changes like max_latitude replace [0] to [1]
