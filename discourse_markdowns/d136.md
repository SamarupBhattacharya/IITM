Please post any questions related to Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent . Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM Update on 27 Jan 2025 : A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub You can use this to validate your code for Project 1. Please note: This is a sample. It WILL change. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure: Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times) Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month. For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

Hi Guddu , I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ? command that I used : uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system. Kind regards Jivraj
getting this issue : openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

yes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you .
While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux? @Jivraj @carlton
The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with. For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions. Regards, TDS TA
what frameworks can we use? hopefully anything? or what frameworks can’t we use? @carlton @Jivraj
Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am 1764×1764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards

@23f1002382 You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks. Kind regards

By clicking the project link ,I am getting the notes…but no project is available in my project 1
