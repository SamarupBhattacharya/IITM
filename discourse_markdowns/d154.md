What if you run out of credits during or just before final evaluation?
This is only for testing on local machine. In docker image keep /data.
One session is going live right now (from 3 to 5 pm). It will be visible from calendra.
sir, It is a humble requests from my side, to plz extend the deadline. Because student like who come from non technical background, are unable to come up with this project… though we have somehow comeup with the GAs taking the helps of groups, seniors and sessions. Moreover I am Dual Degree student. It is very hectic for me. Sir you won’t believe but I am continuously trying since last week. Specially after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing, infront of the computer… Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline…
Sir, I have put my AIPROXY_TOKEN in .env file should I need to push the .env file also in the github
yes sir do we have to put env file also @carlton sir @Jivraj sir
In the evaluation.py there is an import require named from datagen import some stuff. which means inorder to run the evaluation.py we need to manually bring the datagen.py in the working directory… Because in order to run the evaluation.py we need the datagen. plz help…
can someone send the meet link for the live session happening now
Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!
Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file config = {“root”: “/data”} This is where I have been facing the issue. The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

@carlton sir @Jivraj sir  do i have to put env file in docker
you have to give the AIPROXY_TOKEN to the evaluate.py by either bash - export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token" or powershell - $env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token" the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing. so you have to set AIPROXY_TOKEN in both terminals i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals
when I run the evaluation file, i get the following error - Running task: Install uv (if required) and run the script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py with user@example.com as the only argument A1 failed: All connection attempts failed A1 FAILED I am getting the following error when running the evaluation scripts, can someone help me understand what this error is?

Humble request to extend the deadline please. Finding it extremely difficult and having time atleast till Sunday will be really helpful for working professionals like me
All my tasks are running except A9. I have created a .env file and added my token. Despite that I ran commands in both the terminals. A9 still fails.
I second this, have been trying to debug the project for the past 1 week, spending over 4 hours daily and yet facing issues everytime I reopen. An extension of even 24 hours would be extremely appreciated. Please consider this. Thanks.
same issue on my side as well
