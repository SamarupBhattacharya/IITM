Sir i also did the same mistake and am truly sorry for what i did but it is my dearest request if you can look into this matter as it is very essential that the project is evaluated. I am once again very sorry for the mistake
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sirs, I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation. Thank you very much for your time and understanding. api link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/ git 949×580 62.4 KB
The image shows a GitHub repository named "tds_proj2f" with a main branch and one commit labeled "final commit." The repository contains files such as '.env', '.gitignore', 'GA1.html', 'LICENSE', 'README.md', image file, and several Python files ('ga1.py', 'ga2.py', 'ga2_6.py', 'ga2_9.py'). The last commit was two weeks ago.
Respected Sir, I thought we need to submit the deployment url in gform tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app TDS Solver but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL thank you
@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton Respected Sir, Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL: currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/ but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is: https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/ I’m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL Thank you actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir Thank you 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
@carlton I appreciate your response. I didn’t include “/api” at the end. Could you confirm if I’m allowed to update the form now before tonight’s evaluation? Thanks in advance.
I would like to clarify that I had submitted the form before the deadline. However, I believe I might have submitted it once again after the deadline, just to ensure that my project was submitted correctly. Please find attached the screenshot of my submission made before the deadline. Also, I haven’t received any response sheet for the form submitted after the deadline. Thank you! @carlton @Jivraj IMG_20250416_190813 1080×2182 234 KB
This image shows an email from Google Forms confirming the submission of "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025". The email, sent on March 31, 2025, at 11:47 PM to 24ds1000119@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, indicates that the form was received successfully, and offers an option to edit the response. The email uses standard TLS encryption.
hello sir, the link have submitted has a UI interface for solving the question which looks somewhat like this image 1126×936 61.3 KB in order to access the endpoint we just need to add “/api” on the end however in the form I have submitted the link without the end line. Please Consider, Thanks & Regards,
The image shows a "TDS GA Solver" interface. Users can input a question in a text box, optionally upload a file, and submit.  A response box is provided for the solver's answer. The form is designed for asking and receiving solutions related to GA (likely, Genetic Algorithm).
So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.
Hello, For my results, it is marked as absent. Can you please confirm what has gone wrong as I am really confident I have submitted Gform on deadline day around 3-5pm. Thank you @carlton
I’m not able to restart my Virtual Machine as my Azure subscription has expired and my account is disabled. image 1039×650 50.9 KB Please suggest the way forward.
The email from Microsoft Azure notifies the recipient that their free credit has expired, disabling their subscription and services. It prompts them to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription to retain their configured services and data, offering 12 months of free popular products and over 25 always-free products. Unsaved data will be deleted on April 14, 2025.
Since we will be evaluating between 11 to am you can run application on local machine and provide us with the ngrok url by 10:30 pm. Send us the correct endpoint test it before sending us.
@Jivraj I should send ngrok endpoint replying to the same email u sent me right? No extra google form will be there right?
Yes to the same Mail
@Jivraj Dear Sir, I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel. As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation. I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.
* Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint Dear @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently running my server and  trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS : 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS : 1.1.1.1 , 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course! Best regards, Sahil Raj
The image shows a hammer and a wrench crossed over each other. The hammer has a wooden handle and a metallic head, while the wrench is entirely metallic. The tools are likely meant to represent construction, repair, or maintenance.

The image features a square orange icon. Inside the square are two white arrows arranged in a circular fashion, resembling a recycle or repeat symbol. The square has a slight glossy effect, giving it a modern, app-like appearance. It likely represents functions like refresh, synchronize, or exchange.

Will it be possible for the evaluation of vercel link as well i have veen marked absent due to the email issues prevailing please look into this matter
Sir, my endpoint is deployed on render too. Hence it may take upto two minutes for the server to respond. Thankyou!
Thanks. These re evals are running on the gcloud vm so it should not be an issue, but we will check anyway. Its a good tip.
what should i do , i deleted my vm after the email that your evaluation completed , it is said in email that evaluation log and score will be sent but nothing come , it seems my updated api endpoint is not evaluated , score comes from previous endpoint , please what to do now ? again i am saying i deleted my vm @s.anand @carlton
Dear @Jivraj @carlton In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/ whereas the correct api for giving post requests has /api added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/** I have checked again and the post requests are working. I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with  the above endpoint
