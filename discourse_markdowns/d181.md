Dear Sir, I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent. I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue Screenshot 2025-03-07 212639 524×386 47.4 KB

Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir, I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.” I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm? Thank you 1000032712 1080×1032 90.3 KB

Are the marks shown after adding bonus or before?
