Manual correction will not work. Try to extract - from the console. I did it like that it was not working then I extracted from console then it worked
Please ensure that your .yml file should have step name as your email Id. then Manually trigger the task (don’t wait till the scheduled time), ensure it was committed within 5 minutes and that commit should be top most item in all workflows. Then check it, it will work
You can find some text blue in color and underline use some dumy url it will work
You can find some lines having second, third words are uniformly aligned. Those are tables
When I resave the questions, the previously correct questions turn wrong which is extremely frustrating and time taking. I wish there is an option which saves the correct answer and does not require us to have multiple processes running in our pc even after getting the answer right previously.
In Q 6 I checked all the startups link at Hacker News - Newest: "Startup" … none is greater than 81 then how to submit that link… is there something i am missing

The image shows a step in enabling CORS. It asks for the API endpoint URL, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and marked as "Correct". The system will test the CORS configuration by sending requests to the URL, varying the country parameter. A "Check" button is provided to initiate the test.

The image shows a web browser displaying content from a local server at address `127.0.0.1:8000`, with a query parameter `country=india`. The webpage title is "Pretty-print", and it displays the number "44". Other open tabs include "Mathematics for Da..." and "Untitled1.ipynb - Co...".

Sir I have solved  Q2, But a problem arises that, At the index 11, in the IMdb website it is listed “The Recruit” but it is showing Expected: “Graymail”. problem 621×159 42.4 KB How to fix this?
The image displays JSON data representing a list of movie or TV show entries, each containing ID, title, year, and rating. An error is highlighted at the end, indicating a mismatch in the "title" field at index 11. The expected title was "12. Graymail" whereas the actual title was "12. The Recruit".
you have to manually change for a few mismatch. s.anand: @21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly It might need around 6-7 amendments
The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated. In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values: 2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00 2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00 This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.
While submitting solution, do I need to keep all the local servers running/local URLs like 127.0.0.0 stuff, else I am getting one question as correct & the other one mentions unable to fetch data!? So that means I need to run them in different different ports?
I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me. Please help with the second issue. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo. How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works. Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

image 1701×699 64.6 KB how to tackle this error  as in 10 th movie year is 2025 but it is showing 2021
The image shows a task to submit JSON data for a streaming service content acquisition simulation. The JSON provided contains movie details like ID, title, year (2025), and rating.

The Python code attempts to fetch weather data from the BBC website.  It generates a list of dates, maps descriptions to those dates, and then converts the data to JSON.  The code encounters an IndexError: "list index out of range" on line 24, indicating that the list being accessed at the specified index is empty.
