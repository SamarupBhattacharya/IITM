@Jivraj is it fine if i have my AIPROXY_TOKEN in my code instead of getting it as environment variable?
if you do that then during evaluation, it would use your credit limit. if it gets exhausted, you may face problems. @23f2003413
image 266×559 12.5 KB this is what i am doing first using the podman given in the portal and then running the evaluate.py file
The image shows a file directory structure in VS Code, seemingly for a Python project ("TDS-Project-1"). It contains a virtual environment (.venv), an 'app' directory with a 'data' subdirectory (containing Python files and a text file), a .gitignore file, a Dockerfile, and scripts for data generation and evaluation, along with README and LICENSE files. Some files are marked as "U", indicating untracked changes.

ahhh okay, but i am getting an error while trying to fetch the token as an environment variable. any suggestions to fix this issue?
you can use python-dotenv. check that out.
tried that still not getting T_T anyways thanks mate!
No don’t do that, just follow the procedure. Two problems with keeping token in file. It will become public after you push to github. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.
ohh yes, didn’t think it through xD
I am facing the same error. and I have checked for solutions and found none. Did you resolve it? If yes can you please guide me through it?
{ “detail”: “Error code: 401 - {‘error’: {‘message’: ‘Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.’, ‘type’: ‘invalid_request_error’, ‘param’: None, ‘code’: ‘invalid_issuer’}}” }          getting this error sir
