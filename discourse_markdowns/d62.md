Request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 score. Despite submitting the project as per the given deadlines, my portal currently shows a score of 0 . I have cross-checked my submissions and believe there may have been an error in evaluation or in updating the marks.

Below are the key points that I need you to look into: Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK. Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results. No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly. Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project. I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation. I’ve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini My marks are also showing as zero. My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again
Hi everyone, I believe this issue has already been raised, even I got a 0 for my project 2. Is this an error on the backend?

@carlton @Saransh_Saini Sir, i got 0 in project 2 also, please check, there might be some error from your side
Hi Sir, Even I got zero in project 2. My server was running fine and both get and post requests were going through. I stopped the server after I got a confirmation mail that the evaluation were completed. Please check.
Dear TAs please help - even I got 0 in project 2 even though I have submitted the right links with all prerequisites & working server. If you can share some evaluation logs or errors that would be very helpful to know where I went wrong possibly.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I  received 20 in project 2 which I think is not correct. I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.
