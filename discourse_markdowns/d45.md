In Web Scrapping Question The Website will change or it will be same website but the parameters will change of scrapping? @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj
bro ur also direct entry diploma student?  bcz im also having the same issu.. i guess the direct entry to diploma students have this problem in comman
Was the project hosting session recording posted? Carlton sir said he would post it. @carlton
Hi @lakshaygarg654 In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object {"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"} . In any case the value of the "answer" key should be a string.
Hosting it anywhere is fine. Try to deploy on vercel first, if that doesn’t succeed you can use any other hosting technique.
This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL. def run(question, file_path):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api"
    questions = {'question': question}
    files = [
        ('file', open("abcd.zip", 'rb')),
        ('file', open("dcba.img", 'rb'))
    ]
    response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files)
    return response or curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \
  -F "file=@dcba.img" NOTE : This is not the evaluation script.
HI @ripusudan This has been a problem with all direct entry students. Unfortunately, there is no way we can help you with this problem. The best way out is asking a friend who is not a TDS student for this term to create a Azure VM for you.
Yes the websites would be the same.
Saransh_Saini: This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL. def run(question, file_path):

    return response I couldn’t find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling. Saransh_Saini: curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \
  -F "file=@dcba.img" At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data. To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine? Edit: Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight. @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
The image shows a man with short, dark hair and a mustache, wearing a striped blue and white shirt. He appears to be indoors, possibly in a store or cafe, judging by the blurred background with shelves and other objects. He is looking at the camera and has a slight smile.

Here's a summary of the image:

@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice. GA1: Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question WILL NOT be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right? GA2: Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this {
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
} Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right? GA3: Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here. GA4: The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way? GA5: No particular questions at the moment. Please help me out by answering these asap
if you use github student account then no need to verfiy this and you can directly verify through github student account and got credit  i think 150 dollar so you can chose this path also
Hello @22f3001307 , there is an error in the code that needs to be fixed as part of the question: image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0] with image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys())[0])
Sir but i am not a direct entry students
@Saransh_Saini As per your reply time, I was in TDS session at that time. And asked same doubt, @Jivraj said 1st implementation they will use. Session link ( watch at 26:55) Kindly clarify this.
The image displays a "Smiling Face with Open Mouth and Cold Sweat" emoji. The emoji features a yellow face with a broad, open-mouthed smile. It has slightly squinting eyes and a single blue droplet of sweat coming from its forehead, indicating nervousness, awkwardness, or a close call.

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the "answer" key in the JSON object. { "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" } Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object. image 1022×277 11.6 KB
```json
{
 "answer": "The image shows instructions for a JSON response.  It specifies that the response should be a JSON object with a single string field called 'answer'. An example JSON object with a numerical string as the value for 'answer' is provided."
}
```
@Jivraj kindly add-in your thoughts on this.
Response from api should be a string, which if we load using json.loads it should load json object with answer key.
22f3000819: Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question WILL NOT be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right? Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change. 22f3000819: Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this {
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image" This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline. 22f3000819: Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right? Same answer as Q13 GA1 22f3000819: Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal``` One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text: au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u Write a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use: response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs) response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs) response.raise_for_status() response.json() [quote="22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029"]
The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

Full link will be part of question.
The image shows a white letter "S" centered against a solid blue background. The letter appears slightly blurred, creating a soft effect. The simple composition focuses solely on the single letter and its contrasting color palette.

The image shows the letter "S" in white, outlined with a slightly blurred or glowing effect. The background is a solid, vibrant blue color, providing a strong contrast to the white letter. The "S" appears to be simple and clean in design.

The image shows a white letter "S" with a slight blur effect. The background is a solid, bright blue color. The "S" is centrally located in the frame and appears to be a simple, sans-serif font.

The image shows a white, outlined uppercase letter "S" against a solid, bright blue background. The letter appears slightly blurry or out of focus, giving it a soft, diffused appearance. The simplicity of the design focuses attention on the letter and color contrast.

Thanks for the help @Jivraj sir
Dear Sir Is there any limite for request on tokens. because now my model does not generate any output. for any question also not showing any error. could you please explain. When i hit  request on this (curl -X POST “ http://localhost:8000/api/ ” -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data” -F "question=Let’s make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won’t work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 1, 9), 1, 10)) What is the result?") this is not showing any kind of output or error not only on this request any other also.
