till your endpoint has  evaluated
@carlton , @Saransh_Saini sir my roll number is 23f2004462 Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding. New project 2 url:- https://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/
@carlton , @Saransh_Saini same goes for me sir my pc also shut down sir my  roll number is 23f2005141 project 2 url https://b2a4-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/

@carlton @Saransh_Saini Respected sir, by mistake I have submitted the endpoint as : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/ while the corrected api which is deployed on vercel for direct requests is : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ The link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint. kindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ Reg. No -  23f1001995
I think my endpoint has been evaluated, given how POST requests stopped after 3pm. Do I still have to keep it on perhaps through overnight, my laptop now has started to heat up. @Jivraj sir any updates whether my evaluation is completed or not ?.
I kindly request,  if you could please consider reevaluating my assignment. This small error was not reflective of the overall functionality, and I’m worried that the resulting grade might significantly impact my performance and cause me failing  in the course.
Screenshot 2025-04-09 211535 1416×385 20.7 KB I have received this message do this message suggest that my evaluation is successfully completed coz I forgot to add /api at the end of my vercel url . Or is it like the submission had ran but ultimately produced my score 0. If this is the case I request you to reevaluate my submission. @Jivraj @carlton
This email, titled "[TDS Jan 25] Project 2 Announcement," informs a learner that their Project 2 evaluations on endpoints are complete. It states they can now switch off their server and will receive their project score after all evaluations are finished. The email is signed by the TDS Team.
Respected Course Team, Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification image 2096×1154 160 KB regarding an issue with my submission. I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app and the correct API endpoint is: correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake. Thank you for your understanding and support.
The email, "[TDS Jan 25] Important announcement regarding Project 2," informs learners of ongoing server checks.  It asks students who turned off their project servers due to prematurely completed evaluations to turn them back on. They apologize for the inconvenience and promise a notification upon evaluation completion, advising against unnecessary server usage. Do not reply to this email.
Hello sir can you check and say if my server has been evaluated or not ? My roll no : 23f3003871 My endpoint is working smoothly, I am showing it to you in this photo. 1000002702 1920×1440 391 KB
The image shows a Python script in a Google Colab notebook. The script's purpose is to download and process files within a zip file containing data encoded in different formats (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16). It aims to sum values associated with specific symbols ('OR' and 'S') across the files. The script outputs a status code of 200 and the answer "39961".

Vishnu Kumar Jha sent an email, titled "TDS P2 Endpoint," to Saransh. The email provides the public endpoint for Vishnu's P2 API hosted on Azure, specifically: https://vishnu-dns.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api.  Vishnu asks Saransh to report any further issues. His roll number is 23F3004186.
@carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini sir, I kept my laptop on overnight, but in the morning I see my vs-code application and ngrok server along with google chrome was closed on it’s own. I am confused, do I have to run again ? or my enpoint has been evaluated.
i also got this same problem.
Do all of us have to give the latest project link or only those whose links have actually changed. @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj . Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed? PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.
Just submit whatever is the latest working link. You do not have to submit a new form if you have received an email that said your evaluation was completed.
We already sent an email asking people to update their ga7 permissions
@Saransh_Saini Could you let me know if my evaluation is complete?
@carlton , @Jivraj @s.anand @jkmadathil Dear Sirs, Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down. Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise…
