I am also receiving the odd GET requests, however, I don’t believe these are being sent by the evaluation teams. Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets.
Good Evening, I shreyansh Singh have been marked absent even though I submitted, 23f2002745
Maybe. Still clarification from @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini will be highly appreciated.
I too was getting these requests. @carlton sir mentioned this in one of the posts: Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread Tools in Data Science They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed.
Here's a summary of the image:

The image shows a man with short, dark hair and wearing glasses. He is smiling slightly and is wearing a purple shirt. The background is a plain, light yellow color. The lighting is fairly even across his face.

Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I’m guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock That’s LLMs for you! Can’t expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature. 1000040555 1080×1387 193 KB
The image displays a bright yellow emoji face laughing hysterically. The emoji has a wide-open mouth, exposing its teeth and tongue. Its eyes are squeezed shut with joy, and tears are streaming down its face, symbolizing extreme amusement or laughter.

The image displays a JSON file ("22f3001642.json") containing test results. Several tests (identified by "test_code") were conducted. The "status" field indicates whether each test passed or failed. One test ("GA1_q18") resulted in an "ERROR" due to a syntax error within a SQL query. The remaining tests, GA2_q3, GA3_q2, GA4_q6, and GA5_q7, show a status of "PASSED".

I have received the test result of Project 2 todat afternoon, it is showing GA 2 question 2 has failed but my answer is a hardcoded url (“ https://23f2004837.github.io/ ”) from the code. This url is accessible and again tested of the GA platform for the same question and it is working as expected Code: image 1712×1290 285 KB url result: image 898×398 28.9 KB html elements: image 1230×422 40.7 KB GA portal: image 2432×846 224 KB image 1286×228 19.3 KB Please let me know what can I do get the evaluation logs. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @jkmadathil
The image shows a Python file named "Q23.py" from the "GASolver" project on GitHub under the "TDS-Hackers" organization. The code imports "os" and "json", defines an "execute" function that takes a question and a parameter, and attempts to retrieve a URL from a cache based on the "email" parameter or requests value in URL.
The image shows a webpage from a Github.io site, specifically "https://23f2004837.github.io". The content displayed on the page shows the email address "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" rendered in a large font, and again twice below it in different styles.
The image shows the HTML source code as seen in the browser's developer tools, specifically the "Elements" tab. It displays the basic HTML structure (html, head, body), with an h1 tag containing an email address and a paragraph containing a mailto link of the same email address. This is likely a simple webpage displaying and linking an email.

The image shows a web form asking for a GitHub Pages URL. The user has entered a URL, and the system is checking it.  The code, visible in the developer tools, attempts to validate the URL, returning "Incorrect. Try again" if it fails. A cache-busting tip is also shown.
The image shows a question asking what a GitHub Pages URL looks like, with an example URL pattern. The provided answer "https://23f2004837.github.io/" is displayed in a green text box and labeled as "Correct".
What’s the error in the log? It’s GA2 Question 3. I can see u haven’t wrapped your email address inside <!--email_off--> tag.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I have posted my  Project 2 Discrepency here Urgent Attn Needed: Project 2 Discrepency for GA2_q3 and GA1_q18 :
@carlton @Saransh_Saini I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the “http” or “https” prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided. This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed. In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.
@s.anand Subject: Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform Dear Sir/Madam, I hope you’re doing well. I’m Vicky Kumar , a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras . Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called “Vicky App” — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS, . The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What’s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I’ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just ₹199/month , which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It’s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219 Portfolio | LinkedIn It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it. Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219 LinkedIn | Portfolio
The image shows a bright yellow light bulb against a black background. The bulb is glowing, with a visible filament inside. The base of the bulb is a light blue color with the screw threads clearly defined. The overall impression is one of illumination, idea or inspiration.

The image displays a pair of hands in a prayer position or in a gesture of gratitude. The hands are depicted in a cartoonish style with yellow skin and blue sleeves or cuffs. The fingers are interlocked, indicating a reverent or respectful posture.

The image is a stylized email icon on a black background. It depicts a white envelope with a light blue border. Superimposed on the envelope is a large, capitalized letter "E" in a bright blue color with a shadow effect. This likely represents "email" or "electronic mail".

The image shows a stylized smartphone with a black frame and screen. The screen displays a variety of colorful square icons arranged in a grid. The icons are shades of orange, blue, green, and pink, with the lower portion of the screen mostly black and empty.
The image shows a low-resolution, pixelated icon of a globe. It's depicted in a bright blue color against a black background. The globe is represented by a simple wireframe structure with curved lines that circle horizontally and vertically to mimic the Earth's grid.
