Hi Friends, I’ve opened this thread for tracking specific doubts / points / topics that we all want our sir to cover in the session scheduled on Sunday, 18-5-25 Please keep appending your doubts here. Thanks, Prasad.
I don’t know where to start… But let me share this screenshot (part of “uv” installation)… image 1920×1080 302 KB Here, I really did not understand, what I’ve to do, and why? What I don’t have to do, if any? Also don’t know anything about PyPi, Cargo, how they are related to “uv”… More importantly don’t know whether this is a valid doubt or not too. More over, how to express doubts in almost every line (some times feeling shy too). As we (most of the students) are not ready to take up this course (with so many such stupid / doubts), it increases load on the instructors, TAs, and every teaching staff. From students side, this is causing lot of distress, as we struggle to raise so many doubts and get them clarified. By the team we read a line and try to understand what it means, we get another doubt. I strongly feel that “Diploma in Programming” (or set of subjects) must be made as a pre-requisite to this (TDS) course and any other such courses too. Alternatively, we have to create BRIDGE course sort of thing and make it a part of formal curriculum to reduce stress and distress in students and make teaching staff life better. I don’t know whom do I need to take this up, but request our TAs to carry our voice / message to the concerned authorities. Thanks, Prasad.
The image shows documentation for installing "uv", a tool published on PyPI. It recommends using `pipx install uv` for installation within an isolated environment, but also allows `pip install uv`.  It notes that uv ships with prebuilt distributions but may require building from source with a Rust toolchain if a wheel isn't available.  The documentation also covers installation via Cargo.
Just to share my difficulty, another example I wish to share is here below… image 1920×1080 197 KB As mentioned in the screenshot / instructions, I’ve downloaded “README.md” file and then tried to run the specified command “npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum” (I don’t know, what it means and what it does, but still blindly tried to run). I get the below error (screenshot given below). It says "term ‘npx’ is not recognized. image 1920×1080 175 KB To be honest, I don’t even know (however, based on the videos I watched, I think I’ll have to run somewhere in Linux. Is it same as “powershell”? ) where exactly I need to run the command. I’m throwing stones in dark. Unfortunately, even when I get correct answer (like Questions 1 thru 3), I don’t know what that means and what I achieved. This is frustrating (I understand how much it will frustrate our instructors, when we don’t even know what we know and what we don’t know).
The screenshot depicts an online exam, likely related to the IIT Madras Degree Program. The student has about 11 minutes remaining and a score of 0.75/10. The current question involves using "npx" and "prettier" on a "README.md" file, requiring the student to predict the command's output. A subsequent section focuses on spreadsheets like Excel and Google Sheets.
The image shows a Visual Studio Code window with a Python file open. The terminal displays errors indicating that the commands "npx" and "run" are not recognized. The user is attempting to execute a command using `npx` and `run`, likely related to running `prettier` on a `README.md` file to calculate a SHA256 checksum. However, the system fails to find these executable.
Some one guided me that I’ve to install Git & run these commands from Git Bash terminal. I’ve installed Git and tried to run “npx” command from there. Is this not “Git Bash” terminal? image 1920×1080 115 KB This will be my last doubt posting here. Not planning to post any more doubts as our instructors by know understand, our level and how to handle us OR help us from here. Others can keep adding their own doubts as they feel necessary. Thanks, Prasad.
The image shows a terminal in the MINGW64 environment. The user first lists the contents of the current directory, which include files and directories like "LICENSE.txt", "bin/", and "etc/". Then, the user attempts to run the command "npx", but the system responds with "bash: npx: command not found," indicating the command is not recognized.
