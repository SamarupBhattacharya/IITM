@carlton @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email. To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output. Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data? For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response. re-evaluvation-report 1636×1680 311 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-30 1938×934 130 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-46 1948×940 136 KB Success 1922×940 132 KB
The image shows a JSON array of objects representing API test results. Each object contains the API endpoint, a test code, a "FAILED" status, and an HTTP 400 error indicating a "Missing question or file." Five different test codes (GA1_q18, GA4_q6, GAZ_q3, GA3_q2, GA5_q7) against the same API have failed with the same error message.
The image shows a POST request to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" via a tool like Postman. The request body is `form-data` and includes a file. However, the question parameter is not selected, causing a 400 Bad Request error. The response indicates "Missing question or file," meaning the endpoint requires both a question and a file.
A POST request is sent to the `fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint using the "form-data" body type. The request includes a "question" key with a text value. However, the "file" parameter is not selected, causing it to be sent without an attached file. The server responds with a 400 Bad Request, stating "Missing question or file".
The image shows a Postman request made to the `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint. The request uses the form-data format and includes a text question and a file named "abcd.zip". The expected response is a JSON object containing an "answer" key with the value "1234567890", and the expected response code is 200 OK.
WhatsApp Image 2025-04-17 at 19.08.01 1600×385 66.9 KB I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2. As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle POST requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data. Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle GET requests. However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 405 Method Not Allowed errors. These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines. Therefore, I request that the evaluation team only test using POST requests as originally instructed. Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be unfair and incorrect based on the project requirements. Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.
The image shows a JSON-formatted error log from an API.  The "api" points to a Vercel deployment. Two tests, "GA1_q18" and "GA4_q6", have both failed with an HTTP 405 error. The error indicates that the HTTP method used is not allowed for the specified URL.

A POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` was made using form-data. The request included a question and a zip file named "q-move-rename-files.zip" lacking a CSV file. The server responded with a 400 Bad Request error, indicating "No CSV file found in zip." as the expected outcome.
The image displays a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` using form-data. The request includes a 'question' asking for a value and a file 'abcd.zip'. The response is a JSON object containing the key "answer" with the value "3812934199". The zip file contains a CSV file with an updated value, resulting in the expected answer.
The image shows a POST request to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" using the "form-data" format. The request includes a "question" parameter and a "file" parameter with a file named "def.zip." The response is a JSON object with an error message: "Answer column not found or empty," which is expected because the file contained only column names.
image 1430×142 5.42 KB the answer is correct expect for extra spaces it was told that those spaces are neglectable still it showed as error plz consider this @carlton
The JSON response indicates an "ERROR" status from an API endpoint. The error message pinpoints a syntax error within an SQL query. The query attempts to calculate total sales from a "tickets" table, summing "price * units" for tickets where the lowercase "type" equals 'gold'. The "test_code" associated with this error is "GA1_q18".
@Jivraj @carlton this was one of the question it asked on api ‘’‘{ “api”: “ https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ ”, “test_code”: “GA2_q3”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: “ tag not found”, “expected”: “24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in” },’‘’ Now I am demonstrating that my HTML page includes an email tag. You can see it here. image 640×238 10.6 KB and { “api”: “ https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ ”, “test_code”: “GA4_q6”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: “ GitHub - sminez/ad: an adaptable text editor ”, “expected”: “ The 2FA app that tells you when you get `314159` ” } I am unsure of the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‘text editor’, at least 77 points’]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof. image 855×383 19.5 KB and this { “api”: “ https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ ”, “test_code”: “GA3_q2”, “status”: “FAILED”, “actual”: 125, “expected”: “Range: 55 to 65” } I’m not sure what the exact question was, but it was correct for me again. I have another question or doubt.

Case 3: JSON Key Count – XF Parameter (GA5_q7) { “api”: “ https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ ”, “test_code”: “GA5_q7”, “status”: “ERROR”, “error”: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \ -H “accept: application/json” \ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \ -F “file=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

Issue with Marks Not Updated on Dashboard Dear Team, I would like to bring to your attention that although I have successfully passed at least one out of the five questions , the marks have not yet been updated in my dashboard. Kindly look into this issue and update my Project 2 marks accordingly. Thank you for your assistance! @Jivraj @carlton
@23f2002286 and everyone else, At the end of the term operations has a lot of updates to push. We have sent the marks to them, but they have not yet pushed it to the dashboard. As soon as they push it, they will inform us and we will then send out a discrepancy form to all of you if you find any issues. Thanks and Kind regards
I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future . If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities It will be really helpful if you can access the project My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final My vercel link is - https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/
initially I have received a score of 80 for project 2 but today im seeing on my dashboard it is showing 0. I request you to please check the discrepancy. @Jivraj @carlton
my roll no is 23f1002558
My project 2 score is showing absent, roll num is 23f1000561.
Good Afternoon Sir. This is regarding project 1 and project 2. Project-1 Evaluation Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully. Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You
Hi everyone, I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being. Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them. Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon. Kind regards, TDS Team

Sir I have been marked Absent for the ROE exam, I was very much present and got a 4 out of 10, can you please check?
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Why am my I getting GET request to my api endpoint? It must be IITM’s http request because I have not shared it with anyone. image 804×1035 206 KB It clearly written in the project 2 in TDS portal that api  must  accept POST request, not GET . image 1065×440 42.5 KB It is requested to kindly look into this matter and please clarify.
The image displays log entries, primarily showing HTTP GET requests to various resources, including root paths ("/"), specific files like "favicon.ico", "login", or "squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi", and URLs for external services. Many requests are returning a "404 Not Found" error. Some log entries also flag "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings.
The image shows how to make a POST request to a specified API endpoint. The endpoint accepts a question string and an optional file attachment as multipart/form-data.  A `curl` command example is given, posting a question along with a zipped file "abcd.zip".
