Hi Sahil, Please find it at the following location. Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 18.25.31 2474Ã—1306 330 KB Kind regards
The image displays a "Tools in Data Science" course website. It has a navigation menu on the left and content on the right, including links to resources like the course calendar, materials, and TA sessions for January 2025. It provides contact information for teaching assistants.
