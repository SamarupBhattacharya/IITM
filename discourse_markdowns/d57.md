thank you for the swift response
Hey @Saransh_Saini ,  can you please confirm if my report was created or not so that I can turn off the vm on azure if it has been done already. Thank you again!
Hi @Saransh_Saini Hope you’re doing well. If the evaluation process has been completed, kindly let us know so that we can stop the Azure Web App service. My roll number is: 21f3001076 . Thank you! Best regards, Lakshay
@Saransh_Saini Hello sir, my mail id is 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in If possible I would like to know my mark. Thank you
@Saransh_Saini Could you let me know if my evaluation is complete? Would like to shut down my vm.
Yes, @21f2000709 Your entire evaluation has been completed, along with your report generation. You may shutdown your VM.
HARISH.S: 23f3000975 @Saransh_Saini Sir, is my evaluation and project report generation completed.? can i also close the server? my roll no.23f3000975

@Saransh_Saini Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api  → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image 982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image 831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form. Thank you. Regards, Shivaditya
The image displays a log of HTTP requests made to an API.  It shows a series of POST and GET requests to `/api`. Several POST requests receive 302 or 307 temporary redirect responses. GET requests frequently result in a 405 "Method Not Allowed" error. The last POST request succeeds with a 200 OK. The requests are made from a python client.
The image shows a Google Forms submission page for "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025". It requires login with an iitm.ac.in or work email. The form asks for the link to the GitHub repository containing the project code and the API endpoint URL, emphasizing the need for a POST request. A pre-filled email from iitm.ac.in is shown.

@Saransh_Saini One more thing—could you please clarify whether the evaluation process includes both types of responses mentioned in post number 202?
You have been evaluated.
You have been evaluated, successfully.
@Saransh_Saini Have I been evaluated? My roll number is 21f2001573.
@Saransh_Saini Is my project evaluation done yet? my Roll no.: 24f1002555
@Saransh_Saini Hi sir, when will be project 2 results released for all? Thanks, Sujay D
My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days?
Hello @Saransh_Saini can you please confirm if my report was created or not so that I can turn off the vm on azure if it has been done already.
@Saransh_Saini when can expect result today or tomorrow or later?
Probably in 2 days time assuming no problems or other unforseen errors occur.
@Carlton @Saransh_Saini , it would be helpful if you could specify a date — a clear deadline
We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable. This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)
