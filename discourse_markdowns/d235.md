yes this kind errors.
@Abhay222 @22f3002184 if you look closely the expected value is 2024- and actual that you are supplying is 2024 . Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end. reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ?
it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the question itself.
Thank you Tanya for pointing out this issue. Just tell me this, has your city changed? If yes then what was it earlier and what is it now.
any reply regarding this please
22f2000113: For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks
The image shows a single, large, sans-serif letter "M" in white or a very light color. The letter appears slightly blurry or has a subtle glow effect. The background is a muted gray-blue color, providing contrast and highlighting the letter.

GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Here's a summary of the image in under 50 words:

The image shows a man with short dark hair, wearing a blue and white striped shirt, sitting indoors. He is smiling and appears to be looking directly at the camera. The background seems to be a shop or indoor area with some blurred details.

Try changing it manually. Some values keep changing due to change in server.
Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana. Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)” What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-02-09 175948 1823×850 82.3 KB Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database: { “2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-21”: “Sunny and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-22”: “Light snow and a moderate breeze” }
The image shows a coding challenge involving fetching weather data for Nur-Sultan using the BBC Weather API. The task involves retrieving data, extracting relevant information (issue date and weather description), and creating a JSON object mapping the date to the weather description. There is a sample output as well as a user submitted response with an error.
same problem, could anyone help what is wrong.
@AnvithaV check this out
No the city is same as before. But i think it fetches the latest data. As i saved it yesterday it was correct. But today when i  clicked on save button again it got wrong.
What error are you getting ?
how to approach question 8 of ga4
For question #8 . Can I use the .github/workflows that I created for the previous assignments or i need to create a new workflow?
still the same   {“id”:“tt24871974”,“title”:“12. Subservience”,“year”:“2024”,“rating”:“5.4”}, Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2024– ". Actual: “2024”
Change the value manually
I am still not sure why the github action question is not working for me. I have manually triggered the workflow multiple times but i keep getting the same ‘name’ error even though it has been specified in the code. Can somebody kindly help?
Have you given your email id in name ?
