Alright, @Carlton . No problem at all, and thank you for your response. I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience. And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: “Give loose marking for effort!” —because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!

I am not able to see my project marks please look into the problem
Its not been evaluated yet. We are still processing them. Kind regards
So will the solution be based on New MCP style or will they use the same function calling?
Definitely MCP style. Its the most elegant solution and it works beautifully. As soon as evals are done we will showcase it.
@carlton Any ETA on project 1 scores?
I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!

image 412×167 4.49 KB image 439×204 7.25 KB This docker image has outlived many students’ hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course. Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub? What in the April Fools is this It hasn’t even been morning yet! PS ( @carlton @Jivraj ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.
