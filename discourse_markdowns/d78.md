This image shows a student's grade report for a "Tools in Data Science" course. Weekly assignments averaged 100, a programming quiz scored 80, course projects were 10 and 100, and the end-term exam was 68. The overall course grade is 54, a "D." Despite this, the student was allowed to take the final exam.
This email, titled "[TDS Jan 25] Official Scores," informs a student about their grades in "Tools in Data Science". It shows scores for GA1-GA7, Projects 1 & 2, Remote Online Exam, and End Term. It also includes a link to a discrepancy form for any potential errors in the scores. Grades of -1 indicate absence.
The image shows a breakdown of a "T Score" calculation, which is derived from the sum of GAA, P1, P2, ROE, and ET.  GAA is 0.15, which accounts for 15.0. P1, P2, ROE, and ET have values of 2, 20, 16, and 17, respectively. The final T Score is 70.0. A bonus of 0 is only added if the course is passed.
