Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused . It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project. In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue. @Jivraj @carlton
What is expected repo structure ? I have a folder in my repo and dockerfile and license are present in that folder but I still received a mail regarding missing License and Dockerfile.
do we need to have data folder in repo no right?
No, it is not needed

Image URL 'https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg' has an unsupported MIME type ('image/svg+xml'). Skipping explanation.
Yeah. Same issue. Someone who didn’t get this error, please share the MIT license.
https://github.com/saniyanz/tds-p1new check my repo. what s wrong. I ve also got the mail but I`ve included the MIT License and the Dockerfile
Rename LICENSE.txt to LICENSE
I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm. Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?
