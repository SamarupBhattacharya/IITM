It is showing absent for me as well. Kindly check. Thank you.
Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link Assignment solver I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease. (my friends: please don’t use the link, as the api token request will be over) Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0. I don’t know why?..I don’t know whether I could be able to pass this course even with lots of efforts..
sir, my project 2 score is also showing as 0. Please recheck. As many of us are facing the same issue i kindly request to confirm please. Failing in this subject due this will affect us badly.
I am also seeing a score of 0. This is after the course TA’s said that I had scored well on the project without revealing my score. But I am pretty sure they won’t classify 0/100 as a good score.
Sir, I have submitted the working url but forgot to add /api in the end. Please consider my request and evaluate this below link. This below link is same as the submitted link just with /api.

The form is recording responses from the email 2412006749@ds.study.litm.ac.in.

Hello sir @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Could you please check my project 2 evaluation. it is showing 0 but when I tested it worked fine. My api is still running
sir my score is showing zero even if i have submitted the project correctly.please re-evaluate my project https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/
@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I got a mail saying project 2 endpoints will be tested again. It also says that those updated endpoints which were submitted in the google form will be tested. Since i had submitted ngrok endpoint, wont it be invalid now? And if i start ngrok server wont it give me new endpoint?
Although I have completed all the required tasks for Project 2, it is still showing me as absent. I kindly request you to look into this issue, sir. @Jivraj @carlton .
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini hello sir, what will happen if new score is lesser than the old one? will you consider whichever score is greater or new one sir?  Kindly reply sir. and considering the best score in these 2 evaluations is better i think sir. Kindly consider this sir. Thank you Harish
Could someone clarify whether the endpoint should include /api when being evaluated? I submitted it without /api and I’m wondering if it will be automatically appended or if we must include it explicitly. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
