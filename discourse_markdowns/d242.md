This is a screenshot of an online quiz named "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation." It provides instructions including checking answers regularly, saving frequently, and using any resources available. The quiz is hackable. The user is logged in via their IIT Madras email. The deadline is February 21, 2025.  Recent save scores are also shown.
This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that. Kind regards
