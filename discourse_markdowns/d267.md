Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 2 - Deployment Tools . Important Instruction Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide . A friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs ! Deadline: Sunday, February 2, 2025 6:29 PM @carlton @Jivraj

Hi Guddu, Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.
Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem. Try adding CORS to your code it might work. Kind regards Jivraj
github.com GitHub - gkmfrombs/dolfacts Contribute to gkmfrombs/dolfacts development by creating an account on GitHub. I have added email in body two times in different ways.
The image shows a GitHub repository named "dolfacts" under the username "gkmfrombs". It has one contributor, zero issues, stars, and forks. An icon in the top right features green blocks arranged in a patterned grid.
Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 1.39.39 AM 1440×900 154 KB @carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer
The image displays a Python FastAPI application running with Uvicorn. The code defines an endpoint `/api` to retrieve student data, filtered by class if specified in the query. CORS middleware is enabled, and the application reads student data from a CSV file. The terminal output shows Uvicorn running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and successful API requests.
Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok image 1920×886 45.7 KB I tired multiple times but issue is still there. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.
The image shows an "ERR_NGROK_8012" error, indicating the ngrok agent successfully tunneled traffic but failed to connect to the web service at `http://localhost:8080` because the connection was refused. The image suggests ensuring a web service is running on that address or consulting documentation for troubleshooting.
Hi Mishkat, Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily. eg if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello") Please use this discourse etiquette to share code. Thanks and kind regards
sir did you check yet what is the problem in this one?
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing import List, Optional
import csv

app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers

# Load student data from the specified CSV file

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
Hi Mishkat, This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only. kind regards
thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted
Hi Guddu, Inside index.html file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else. This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page. kind regards.
I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop Error 558×377 27 KB I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator). wsl --version WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011 Tried many solutions after googling for the issue. So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
Docker Desktop displays an error message indicating an unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command. The message suggests solutions: shutting down WSL using `wsl --shutdown`, rebooting, or reinstalling WSL/Docker Desktop. The error concerns deploying WSL2 distributions, specifically an issue importing the Docker Desktop distro where "WSL2 is not supported with" is displayed.  Options to gather diagnostics or quit are present.
Hi Telvin, Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations. I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network. kind regards kind regards
@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop . Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.
@22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
