Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments Why? If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well? Too many Questions for LLM True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it? How? If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful Where? github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project2-QuestionBank README.md main # TDS-Project2-QuestionBank

## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.
