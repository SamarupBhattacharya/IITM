In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with --n-gpu-layers 35 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that. @carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.
image 717×212 8.67 KB here it is giving output but when i run on question page it gives error. image 837×232 10.8 KB please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m
The image shows a web browser displaying a JSON response from an API endpoint. The URL is "new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m". The JSON data shows "marks" with a list of numerical values which is 5 and 78.  There is also a checkbox labeled "Pretty-print."

The image displays a form field prompting for a Vercel URL, with an example provided. The user has entered "https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api".  An error message appears below, indicating that the submitted URL does not match the expected format or validation criteria. The "Check" button implies a verification process.
Try these @21f3000745 Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy. If this doesn’t work, then: Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.
yeah it worked. thankyou @Saransh_Saini actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question so tedious.
So the problem was with the JSON data or you just clicked again on check and it worked?
i loaded the data again as you said and clicked on check again. then it gave correct
Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ , For the ngrok tunnel question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to keep all servers running when clicking the Save button. Also, I couldn’t find the GitHub Pages URL in your GA2 response , and many answers are unmarked. It seems you didn’t click the Save button . Your current score is 4.5/10 .

The screenshot shows IIT Madras's online learning platform displaying "Graded Assignment 2." The due date is February 2, 2025. Multiple submissions are allowed, with the last one graded.  It suggests disabling ad blockers, enabling cookies and JavaScript, and using Chrome. A student ID is required for the submission to be evaluated. A link to access the assignment is also provided.
I am facing several problems with the submission portal … In question  no 5 I entered the answer 78918 It was correct , I submitted it after few hours when I reloaded the portal its showing incorrect … I tried to enter twice thrice also solved it again but no use… In question 10 I entered the required link it was correct after saving it and reloading the portal it shows incorrect … In question 9 I did all the necessary thing but the portal is showing couldn’t fetch … My system is able to fetch the data but the portal says “failed to fetch” Screenshot 2025-02-02 194829 1626×509 48.5 KB Screenshot 2025-02-02 194815 1140×975 20 KB Screenshot 2025-02-02 194801 1626×531 38 KB
The image shows a terminal output from a FastAPI application running with Uvicorn. It indicates the server is running, watching for changes in the specified directories.  GET requests to the root and "favicon.ico" result in 404 errors, while GET requests to "/api" and "/api?class=1A" return a 200 OK status.

The image displays a JSON response from a local server at `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`. It shows a list of students under the "students" key. Each student object contains "studentId" and "class" attributes, with all students belonging to the "1A" class and having various IDs.
The task is to create an API endpoint using FastAPI that filters students by class based on the "class" query parameter. CORS must be enabled. The provided URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` failed to fetch, and the system will test it with a class query.

Hi @23f2000573 , As error mentions to add tag to image. Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled. For adding tag use image 1351×578 40.8 KB
The image shows commands for building, running, and deploying a container. It begins with creating a Docker Hub account and logging in. Then, it builds and runs a "py-hello" container using `podman`.  Finally, it pushes the container to Docker Hub, using a username and optionally adding a tag, such as "dev".
For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not. Just answer on GA2 page TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools .
Hi @24f1002359 For Question 10 , ensure that all servers are running every time you submit (click the Save button). Since ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs , double-check that the ngrok URL is correct before submitting. For Question 9 , did you enable CORS ? To verify, check your browser console —if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue. image 724×136 18.3 KB For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally. Kind regards.
The Chrome DevTools console shows an XMLHttpRequest to `http://google.com/` being blocked by a CORS policy. The error indicates the server at google.com doesn't provide the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, preventing requests from origin 'null' which typically indicates the code is being run from a local file. The console logs also show the start and end of an AJAX request.
for question 9 u can use , from fastapi import FastAPI, Query and
The Python code defines an API endpoint using FastAPI framework. The `@app.get("/api")` decorator registers a GET route at `/api`. The `api` function takes an optional `class_` parameter. This parameter is annotated as either a list of strings, or None, and can be passed as a query parameter using the alias "class". The default value of the parameter is None.
Dear Sir, Thank you very much sir for your kind reply. I have published the page on GITHUB and this is the screen shot. As you see the url link is: https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/ But I dont know the GA portal does not accept the answer. That also I have given a screenshot. Please look into it sir. I am loosing 1 precise mark !!! thanks and regards, ULAGAOOZHIAN image 1920×1200 121 KB image 1920×1200 137 KB Sir, the page I have published via GITHUB is as below: image 3072×1920 200 KB
The image shows the settings page for GitHub Pages within a repository called "TDS-page" owned by "ULAGADOZHIAN". The GitHub Pages site is live at `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/` and was last deployed 19 hours ago. The site is built from the main branch, and custom domain options are available.
The screenshot shows an online exam question regarding publishing a GitHub Page with a specific email address included in the HTML, obfuscated using Cloudflare. The user has entered a GitHub Pages URL, but an error message indicates the required email is not found in the response from that URL. The instructions mention adding "?v=1, ?v=2" to the URL to bypass caching issues if needed.
The image shows a web browser displaying a simple webpage titled "My Model Page." The page includes a contact email address: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in. The URL of the page is ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/. Several other tabs are open in the browser, including "My Dashboard," "WOL: Complex Data," "BOM Capstone," "About the Course," "Graded Assignment," and "TDS 2025 Jan GAZ." The browser is in a private navigation mode.

Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ , That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a .nojekyll file in your root folder of your repository. image 1900×809 131 KB Kind regards
The image shows a website development context. On the left, a user is attempting to input a GitHub Pages URL, but there's an error. The entered URL doesn't return the expected email, judging from the code snippet shown in the error. The right side of the image shows the Chrome DevTools, specifically the network tab, showing a request to "TDS-page/" and its preview displaying "My Model Page."
I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned image 1630×575 64 KB The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it image 1917×976 180 KB Sample class example that I tried manually is below image 1919×1079 185 KB The main code is below import sys

The image describes an API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` which accepts a query parameter "class" to filter students. The API should return students belonging to the specified classes, maintaining the original CSV order.  However, the provided response does not match the expected data based on the class query.
The image displays a JSON array of student objects. Each object contains a "studentId" (numerical) and a "class" (string). The data seems to represent a list of 252 students with corresponding class assignments, loaded in a pretty-print format on a web browser.
The image displays JSON data in a web browser, accessed via localhost (127.0.0.1:8000) with a query parameter "class=3Q". The JSON represents a list of "students," each with a "studentId" and "class" set to "3Q."  Several student IDs are listed, suggesting a query result listing students in class 3Q.
Gentleman, Will you consider my mark or not ?
Gentleman, I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the url of my github repository. It worked !
The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen. If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list. I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s showing not submitted. image 2762×424 36.3 KB image 1818×460 33.4 KB
The image displays a list of "Recent saves" from a game. Each save includes a "Reload" option, the date "02/02/2025," and the time of saving, along with a "Score". The top two saves have a score of 10, while the oldest save has a score of 8.5.
The image displays the status of "Graded Assignment 2" within "Module 2: Deployment Tools". The assignment, due February 2, 2025, is marked as "Not Submitted". The score, peer average, and median score are all listed as "-", indicating no score is available since the assignment has not been submitted.
