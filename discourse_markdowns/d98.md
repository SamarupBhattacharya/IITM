But in email u said n , your repo was not public, even not had dockerfile nor mit licence that’s what I mentioned.
Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.
I got email , your repo was not public even had not a dockerfile nor mit licence, that’ what I mentioned.
My repo is public even before it was. How can I set to public..thisis same n while creating new repo u just select the public and not private that’s it n.
What else I can do . For public.
You misspelt your repo. Did you even check the post i sent with your details? Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science Hi Hari,

I am not talking about this , just see the snapshot that I applied above on that email u said your repo is not public
We are ONLY going to evaluate what you submitted. Its the same rule for everyone. If the repo you provided is not accessible,  you will not be evaluated.
Okay tell me one thing if I got fail in this course then in the next term, I will have not to give roe because it’s rule for every other courses.And see provide the content of tds in Indian guy youtuber because we belong to rural areas and not able to understand the accent of foreigners youtuber . It’s kind your sympathy.

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1 OR 2) Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files  in the repo please consider it) @carlton @Saransh_Saini @s.anand (i have already made a rookie mistake in my dockerfile otherwise i would have got 9/25 but keeping that aside please let me get 6/25)
