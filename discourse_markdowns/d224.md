@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Is there any way to crack this , I tired multiple time no improvement. Also what does this " It is very hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean. image 1327×743 41.6 KB
The image presents an exercise involving PDF to Markdown conversion, using Prettier for formatting. It highlights the "Impact" of automating this process: enhanced productivity, improved quality, scalability, and integration. The task requires extracting PDF content, converting it to Markdown, formatting with Prettier, and submitting the result. The current submission is incorrect, with the instructions noting the difficulty of the task.
Same problem please help me too if you get it right.

balbus comminor et In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time. I have tried these steps: import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode()) Then i run this in bash prettier --write output.md And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf. #Can someone please advise me a better approach?
