Hello, I’m currently working on Module 2, Question 11 of the **TDS ** course, which involves using Google Cloud . While trying to create a new project in the Google Cloud Console with my IITM ID, I’m getting this error: “You must select a parent organization or folder.” I understand this might be because our IITM account is part of an organization, and Google Cloud requires selecting a parent organization or folder. However, I don’t see any options to select from. Could someone please guide me: How to proceed with project creation?
