Screenshot 2025-04-07 174256 1710×518 33 KB I submitted the project within the deadline , and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled , including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. Thank you for your understanding. @Jivraj
