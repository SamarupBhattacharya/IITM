We are checking you submission. We will get in touch shortly.
@carlton @jivraj @s.anand , I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy. Thank you for your time and understanding.
Issues with your submission has been resolved. Thanks for raising the issue and checking it at your end.
Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it. @Jivraj @carlton

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.
I have passed the pre requisites, but there is no log file for my email. At least docker logs should be there, right? Was it missed by any chance? @Jivraj @carlton image 916×160 14.7 KB

Sorry to repeatedly ask @carlton @Jivraj couldnt see my id (22f3002723) in any of the logs  evaluation or docker .. was there any issue in building image out of docker file in github
Hi @22f3002723 /bin/sh: 1: uv: not found This is error that we got on your evaluation while building docker image through github repo. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

This was error with your submission. tried copying file named app which is not there in github repo
Respected Sir , @carlton @Jivraj My roll number is 23f3001688 Pls check my repository properly because I have dockerfile in my repo but it is mentioned that it is not present. Here is my repository link and screenshot for your reference sir and the dockerfile is present sir github.com GitHub - Sharmilecholan/tds_project1 Contribute to Sharmilecholan/tds_project1 development by creating an account on GitHub. I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase. Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test. Regards, S Sharmile 23f3001688 image 1904×778 83 KB

I don’t know how to check for the errors I made, @Jivraj sir can you at least show the prerequisite form that I submitted so I can check for myself ?.
@jivraj earlier I built the project inside app folder so it was COPY app /app it should have been COPY . /app Is there anything that can be done on your end now? All the code is there.

No we don’t consider any changes after deadline.
There was a module missing error while lead the docker image to run. Follow below steps for replicating test environment. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA
For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science You can take it up with @s.anand I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. 

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. 

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…
