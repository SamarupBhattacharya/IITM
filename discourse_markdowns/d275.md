Even there is no submission button provided in GA2 and GA3 on the portal unlike Graded Assignment 1. image 2152×1012 269 KB
The image shows that "Graded Assignment 2" is past its due date (2025-02-02). It mentions that final submissions before the deadline will be graded and lists potential access issues, such as ad blockers, cookies, JavaScript, browser extensions, and antivirus software. Student IDs are mandatory for assignment evaluation, and a link to the assignment is provided.
same problem, please sir @carlton consider this GA marks otherwise our efforts will be wasted
We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal. Regards, TDS TA
Saransh_Saini: ers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal. Regards, Does this go for GA1 also ?
Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.
Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this: image 1920×1080 214 KB So it’s confusing. Just Checked my Score Card. image 1920×1080 271 KB Thank you for your attention to our problems you are the real heroes. @Saransh_Saini
